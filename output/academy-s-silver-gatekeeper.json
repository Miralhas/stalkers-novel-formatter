So expect in-game banter before the story shifts to the main plot in Chapter 1.</p><p>djajsltptkddp (Kaaktherin): Our promotion match to mid-tier.</p><p>killNyang (Beritz Kring): If we win, we hit silver.</p><p>killNyang (Beritz Kring): This is irritating.</p><p>Life is a tragedy when viewed from afar and a comedy when up close. As if my life wasn’t hard enough, the people here make it even worse. Ten seconds in, and this is the atmosphere? It gives me chills.</p><p>[All] HiksSaveMe (Callen): Guys, our mid-lane has two wins.</p><p>[All] HiksSaveMe (Callen): Are you in a promotion match too?</p><p>[All] killNyang (Beritz Kring): Yeah, we are. Our mid has two wins too.</p><p>In the middle of this chaos, I found a comrade. Even with the exact same two wins. They say the end of a season feels like the end of the world, and it really does. I had to make it through before the tragic finale. Postponing the promotion match due to work led to this mess.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): Gather in mid-lane.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): Let’s pick one worthy person.</p><p>[All] djajsltptkddp (Kaaktherin): Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!</p><p>The mid-lane became a gathering spot, and I hoped someone would cast the first skill. If just one person betrayed the group, it’d be a great excuse to play fiercely.</p><p>But against my expectations, all eight players truly gathered in mid-lane. No one made the first move.</p><p>These bastards. They only unite like this when it’s inconvenient for me.</p><p>[All] Ping9Ping9 (Two Sets): Give me your reasons for wanting a promotion.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): We’ll spare only one sincere player.</p><p>What a spectacle of the end times. I never imagined I’d have to give a self-introduction here. Is this what it’s come to? Something wells up inside me, but I can’t let it out.</p><p>Today marks the 99th attempt. Damn it, my 99th silver promotion match. I’ve failed 98 times. Always facing the so-called “Gatekeepers.”</p><p>Please, team. Let me escape bronze. How long do I have to listen to people call me an ‘eternal bronze’? At least let me slap a silver badge on my name before I quit or do anything else.</p><p>[All] TeamHAJA (Hari): Smurf account here, good luck.</p><p>A rope of salvation descends. The opposing promotion player claims to be on a smurf account!</p><p>[All] killNyang (Beritz Kring): No way.</p><p>[All] Ping9Ping9 (Two Sets): Hari, What rank is your main account?</p><p>[All] TeamHAJA (Hari): Gold 3.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): LOL, what nonsense.</p><p>The response is enthusiastic. Maybe I can redirect their focus. It feels like they’re trying to reduce the fun by calling out the lie.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): Hey, Opposing team, our Hari says it’s a smurf. Let them stay in bronze.</p><p>[All] Ping9Ping9 (Two Sets): You believe that? Why would a gold-tier be here?</p><p>[All] killNyang (Beritz Kring): Lying adds to your guilt, you know.</p><p>There’s hope. Yeah, 99 failed promotions is too much. Surely heaven will recognize this as unfair and grant me a break. Let me shake off the eternal bronze curse and breathe silver air for once.</p><p>[All] djajsltptkddp (Kaaktherin): Let’s just go to our lanes.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): Agreed. Let’s plan as we play.</p><p>The gatekeepers return to their roles. If only they’d just focus on the game.</p><p>[All] Ping9Ping9 (Two Sets): Hey, mid-laner, say something. LOL.</p><p>[All] killNyang (Beritz Kring): How much are you willing to offer?</p><p>[All] killNyang (Beritz Kring): If you pay now, I’ll play seriously.</p><p>Now I understand why Satan lost his job.</p><p>killNyang (Beritz Kring): No response?</p><p>- An ally has been slain -</p><p>[All] HiksSaveMe (Callen): Say something before you throw. At least we’d know how to adjust.</p><p>- An enemy has been slain -</p><p>You die once, I die once. Tears almost come to my eyes in this harmonious exchange. How is it that getting promoted feels harder than finding a job? Is this game run by Satan?</p><p>[All] TeamHAJA (Hari): I’m blocking everyone and focusing on the game.</p><p>The opposing team’s player chose to block everyone. Whether that’s wise or foolish, I can’t say.</p><p>What followed was a dog-eat-dog game of death, where players fell one after another. Some were unhappy with Hari’s attitude and began suggesting they drop the player.</p><p>The rest of the team seemed to be on board with the plan. At least, I tried to play along.</p><p>- An ally has been slain -</p><p>- An ally has been slain -</p><p>- Quadra Kill! -</p><p>But what the hell? Why is this game falling apart so fast?</p><p>[All] KarangKakakang (Naisa): Sorry, I’ve got cram school in 20 minutes. Let’s speed this up.</p><p>Is it a real cram school, or are they just pretending? At the very least, could they tell the truth?</p><p>[All] killNyang (Beritz Kring): Lord, we’ve blocked one more today!</p><p>[All] Ping9Ping9 (Two Sets): Adding that to life achievements.</p><p>[All] Park Yujin (Malang Kai): Ha, easy win for us.</p><p>[All] KarangKakakang (Naisa): Sorry, SwagGod, my bad.</p><p>[All] TeamHAJA (Hari): Mid diff.</p><p>- Defeat! -</p><p>And just like that, the dream of silver shattered again.</p><p>- You failed your promotion -</p><p>I stared blankly at the screen for a moment before queuing up for another match. At this point, I wasn’t even angry anymore. No laughter, either. Just... acceptance.</p><p>99 promotion failures. The 99th descent of the Silver Gatekeeper. I never dreamed that my one wish in life would become, getting to silver rank. Ha-ha. Damn it. You bastards.</p><p>“…Damn it.”</p><p>I’d heard that the trend these days was to avoid reckless comments online. So, I didn’t comment. I swear. I didn’t even look at the comments section.</p><p>[Assessment Department – Baek Seojin]</p><p>- The Third Eye is activated.</p><p><code>◎ Baek Seojin</code></p><p><code>Low level civil servant.</code></p><p><code>◎ Details</code></p><p><code>Happiness increases after stopping work.</code></p><p>But why on earth did I end up possessing a character in this novel?</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 1</h1><p>The life of a low-level civil servant is miserable. The salary is almost laughably low, but the workload is overwhelming. If a complaint comes in, you have to handle it, even if it’s in the middle of the night. If the complainer acts out, you can’t lose your temper. If your superior yells at you, you become their punching bag. If they give you more work, you become their slave.</p><p>But the worst part? This life wasn’t even one I chose.</p><p>Baek Seojin. An employee of the Superpower Assessment Department. Below average as a civil servant. Below average as a superpowered individual. The kind of person who’d make a perfect extra in the background.</p><p>That’s me. To be precise, that’s who I became.</p><p>“Seojin, there’s a dispatch request for you.”</p><p>“What? Me? Why me?”</p><p>“Who else but you? Is there anyone else in this department?”</p><p>There are plenty of other people, though. Why me, of all people? I wanted to throw the resignation letter I’d been keeping in my bag at them.</p><p>I wanted to, but with rent coming up next week, I bit my tongue. Even after being transported into another life, I couldn’t escape financial struggles.</p><p>Other people possess dukes or chaebols. If I had known this would happen, I would’ve read a fantasy novel.</p><p>“Where am I being sent? It’s not a daycare again, is it…?”</p><p>“The Academy. A position just right for someone like you opened up.”</p><p>“What about the person sent two weeks ago? Didn’t they fill it already?”</p><p>“They’re in the hospital.”</p><p>They went to an educational institution and ended up hospitalized? What does that even mean?</p><p>“Why are you still standing there? Get ready.”</p><p>I wanted to ask why, how, and where they got hurt. It felt like my survival depended on knowing. But my boss cut me off with a curt dismissal. What a bastard.</p><p>Before leaving their sight, I activated the skill given as my transmigration perk, “The Third Eye.”</p><p><code>◎ Lee Chungin</code></p><p><code>A typical asshole.</code></p><p><code>◎ Details</code></p><p><code>Increases hostility in others with every word spoken.</code></p><p>Of course, he was an asshole.</p><p>…</p><p>[Breaking News: A series of gates has opened in the Seongnam City, Bundang District area….]</p><p>[Retired superhumans are demanding improved treatment for injured personnel….]</p><p>Humans are said to be creatures of adaptation. I was no exception. There was a time when I screamed at the absurdity of it all.</p><p>Now, even if a gate opened nearby, I remained indifferent. News of a pay cut for civil servants bothered me far more. I didn’t see a way back to my world, so surviving here was my only option.</p><p>These days, I dreaded complainants and bosses more than monsters or villains. At least with the latter, their intentions were clear. With the former, not so much. And while I could run from monsters, there was no escaping the others.</p><p>“Damn this civil-servant life.”</p><p>I cursed my past self again. If I’d known, I would’ve read villain-revenge novels instead.</p><p>[Next stop: Academy Station, Academy Station.]</p><p>The start of my glorious forced assignment. I could only hope to get through today safely and leave on time.</p><p>As I exited the train, a group of students, presumably from the Academy, got off as well.</p><p>Lucky them. Some of us lack talent and get stuck in civil service. Those kids are probably living bright lives as heroes, courted by clans and whatnot.</p><p>It stung. For someone who had possessed a body, I had no extraordinary talent to speak of. In the novels I’d read, people usually had hidden potential or powerful families. The character I’d become? None of that applied.</p><p>At least I had one perk: The Third Eye. But even that wasn’t enough to accomplish anything remarkable.</p><p>“Better hurry.”</p><p>Being late on the first day would earn me a terrible reputation. After walking for ten minutes past the station, I spotted the Academy gates.</p><p>I presented my ID to the guard at the entrance.</p><p>“Where are you from?”</p><p>The guard’s slightly tense expression caught my eye. If I said, “I’m here for an inspection,” would they faint? Relax, I’m not from that department. I’m just a low-level worker.</p><p>“I’m from the Superpower Assessment Department. I’ve been assigned here.”</p><p>“One moment, please. Assessment Department… Ah, found it.”</p><p>The guard’s face brightened for a moment, then gradually shifted into something… odd.</p><p>“Oh… you must be the new ranking examiner. Oh dear….”</p><p>Why the long sigh? And why that pitiful look?</p><p>“Welcome to the Academy, Baek Seojin. The faculty office is on the second floor, straight ahead.”</p><p>“Thank you. Good luck with your work.”</p><p>“Oh no, you’ll need more luck than me.”</p><p>What was with the ominous tone? If no one had been waiting behind me, I would’ve asked.</p><p>Inside the Academy, it was grander than I’d imagined. Apparently, the budget for building it was equivalent to a year’s national defense budget.</p><p>Some joked that money had been slathered on like cement. It didn’t seem like a joke anymore.</p><p>“Superhumans are society’s elite,” they said. The Academy certainly lived up to that.</p><p>Even the staff at the gates weren’t soldiers or police but superhumans. The faculty were all superhumans, too. Even the janitorial staff had powers.</p><p>No wonder villains constantly targeted the Academy but never succeeded. The defenses were overwhelming. Send in just anyone, and they’d get beaten up by the cleaning lady.</p><p>Why was I sent to such a terrifying place? No matter how I thought about it, nothing good seemed to lie ahead….</p><p>“Hey! Watch out!”</p><p>Hearing the shout, I instinctively dove to the ground. Overreacting? Hardly. This reflex has saved me more than five times already.</p><p>Sure enough, my instincts didn’t fail me.</p><p>Whoosh—!</p><p>A fireball passed exactly where my head had been two seconds earlier. Starting my assignment with a life-threatening incident—how fitting. The wildest part was wondering if this would qualify as a workplace injury.</p><p>As I dusted myself off, someone ran toward me.</p><p>“I-I’m so sorry!!”</p><p>It was a trembling female student, bowing her head repeatedly.</p><p>“I was careless! I’m really sorry! Are you hurt?”</p><p>“No, I’m fine. It didn’t even graze me, so don’t worry too much.”</p><p>The Academy was said to house only the elite among South Korea’s superhumans. I’d heard most of them were incredibly arrogant and insufferable.</p><p>‘That must’ve been an exaggeration.’</p><p>This seemed right. Who would act cocky after almost hurting someone?</p><p>“What are you doing apologizing? That guy walked into the training area.”</p><p>…Turns out, some people can act cocky. And this one’s a tattooed thug.</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye.</p><p>◎ Park Junwoo</p><p>Tattooed creep who wants women.</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>Women instinctively frown upon seeing him.</p><p>Wow. The accuracy is uncanny. The possession perk really delivers.</p><p>“Excuse me. You can’t just walk into the training area like that. Don’t you see the signs?”</p><p>The Tattooed Thug, Park Junwoo pointed toward a sign in the area.</p><p>[Caution: Training Area. Risk of Injury.]</p><p>Seriously? If it&#39;s that dangerous, couldn’t they at least put up a fence or something? The path led straight here. How was I supposed to know it was a training ground?</p><p>I’d cursed him out in my mind multiple times already.</p><p>But unfortunately, I wasn’t just anyone right now. I was a civil servant with a duty to serve the people.</p><p>“My apologies. It’s my first day at the Academy.”</p><p>“…Are you a professor?”</p><p>“No, I’m here as a dispatched civil servant.”</p><p>“Oh. Just a lowly civil servant.”</p><p>This bastard. Even this kind of punk looks down on me now? But there’s nothing I can do. That’s just how society works.</p><p>Superhumans with exceptional talents are treated like elites. Especially those skilled enough to enter the Academy—those people have guaranteed futures. Even a tattooed thug like this guy can become a prized match if his abilities are good enough.</p><p>A dirty world that only values superpowers!</p><p>Getting into a fight here would only hurt me. A brawl between a civil servant and a superhuman Academy student? Even I’d side with the student in that case. And if I got into a fight, I’d immediately get yelled at for not maintaining the “dignity” of my position.</p><p>Ignoring any potential taunts about cowardice, I headed for the faculty office. As I walked, a few students eyed me with curiosity, only to immediately avert their gaze when they noticed the ID around my neck.</p><p>Why was the image of civil servants so bad here? And why had the original owner of this body done nothing about it? I was seriously considering quitting as I reached the faculty office.</p><p>After a quick introduction, they asked me to wait. It felt like they were about to bring in a superior. Oh, how I wanted to go home already.</p><p>“Are you Baek Seojin?”</p><p>I looked up to see a stunning woman standing before me. I jumped to my feet—not because she was a woman, but because of the name tag on her chest.</p><p>“Hello, Lord Han—”</p><p>“Just call me Professor. That’s fine here.”</p><p>The woman seated across from me with a smile was none other than Han Jiyoon, one of Korea’s five S-rank superhumans. She was also the head of one of the world’s top five clans, earning her the title “Lord.”</p><p>She was someone who could hold her head high anywhere in the world. From what I’d heard, she even received state-level receptions. It was an achievement she’d accomplished in her twenties, and of course, she had countless fans.</p><p>I’d recently seen news of her unexpectedly applying to become an Academy professor.</p><p>So yesterday, when people heard I was being dispatched to the Academy, some were envious.</p><p>“Stop spouting nonsense,” I’d snapped at them. “Do you really think someone like her would bother showing her face for a low-level civil servant? If I even see her, it’ll be a miracle.”</p><p>“Welcome to the Academy.”</p><p>Yet here she was. Surprise! Maybe I owed those people an apology.</p><p>“You seem very surprised.”</p><p>“Oh, yes. Honestly… it doesn’t feel real yet.”</p><p>“Are you surprised that I came out to meet you in person?”</p><p>I nodded reflexively at Han Jiyoon’s question.</p><p>Globally, there were fewer than a hundred S-rank superhumans. One of them, Han Jiyoon, had come to personally greet a lowly civil servant? If this got out, there’d be no shortage of people coming to strangle me out of jealousy. Even now, there were plenty of curious eyes watching from beyond the room.</p><p>“That makes sense. It is surprising. But I had no other choice.”</p><p>“I don’t follow. What do you mean?”</p><p>Han Jiyoon offered a faint smile, then handed me some documents.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>“Take a look first. You can ask questions afterward.”</p><p>An ominous feeling crept over me as I cautiously examined the papers.</p><p>By the time I was halfway through, I understood everything.</p><p>“You bastards.”</p><p>My department had sent me as a sacrificial lamb.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 2</h1><p>Injury. Injury. Injury.</p><p>It turned out I wasn’t the only one dispatched to the Academy. Other staff from nearby assessment departments had been sent here as well. Every single one of them left due to injuries.</p><p>The only silver lining was that none of the injuries were life-threatening. The worst case had been a broken bone.</p><p>“What is this supposed to be?”</p><p>“Before I explain, I’d like to sincerely apologize.”</p><p>Han Jiyoon bowed her head, which only made my position more uncomfortable. The professors watching from behind the scenes were glaring daggers at me. Once I left this room, their stares would surely get worse.</p><p>“You’re probably aware that today’s superhumans are different from before.”</p><p>I’d heard about it. There was an ongoing debate over the ethics of superhumans.</p><p>It had been quite some time since random individuals began developing superpowers. In the chaotic early days, monsters appeared, and villains misused their abilities. The so-called “First Generation” superhumans fought against these threats,</p><p>cementing the idea that superhumans were heroes.</p><p>They were expected to face danger and even sacrifice themselves.</p><p>But the “Second Generation” began to question this ideal.</p><p>They acknowledged the responsibility of superhumans but rejected the expectation of sacrifice.</p><p>“We’re people, too. We’re just trying to make a living.”</p><p>The resulting conflict between generations had been discussed on debate shows.</p><p>Truthfully, while the ideals of the First Generation were noble, they were difficult to follow. Who would willingly risk their life to save strangers?</p><p>“I understand. It’s a complicated issue.”</p><p>“As a civil servant, I’m sure you’d know. Anyway, because of this, it’s become difficult to control new Academy students. For them, being a superhuman is just a career, not a calling. And if anyone challenges them, the Human Rights Commission steps in.”</p><p>Han Jiyoon sighed and pointed to the documents I was holding.</p><p>“Recently, some of the students have turned this into a challenge.”</p><p>“What kind of challenge?”</p><p>“See how quickly they can take out a rank examiner.”</p><p>For a moment, I was at a loss for words.</p><p>“Why would they do something like that?”</p><p>“Are you aware of the Academy’s ranking system?”</p><p>I nodded. Preparing for an assignment meant knowing at least the basics.</p><p>The Academy divided students into ranks from Bronze to Diamond. Unlike the national system of E to S-rank, the Academy had its own league.</p><p>Graduation wasn’t guaranteed after four years. If a student didn’t meet the standards, they couldn’t graduate—and in severe cases, they could be expelled.</p><p>Reaching Gold was required to graduate. Platinum students were scouted by clans during the semester. Diamond students were treated as prodigies, with organizations vying for them. Master-ranked students were considered S-rank candidates and monitored by the state.</p><p>&quot;Lower ranks are assessed by my department, while higher ranks are tested by professors, as I understand it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s correct. The Bronze-to-Silver test is extremely simple. The examiners aren’t particularly strong, either. Oh, my apologies if that offended you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It’s fine. It’s the truth, after all.&quot;</p><p>I know I’m weak. My abilities are hardly worth being called superpowers.</p><p>&quot;But for some reason, some students deliberately get themselves demoted to Bronze, then harass the Silver assessment examiners. Outwardly, they say things like, &#39;How can someone so weak evaluate us? Bring someone competent!&#39; But in reality…&quot;</p><p>&quot;They’re just showing off how nasty they can be.&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon nodded weakly.</p><p>That raised a question.</p><p>If it were just a few immature troublemakers, wouldn’t a single glare or a clearing of the throat from someone like Han Jiyoon be enough to scare them straight?</p><p>&quot;The higher-ups have forbidden intervention. They don’t want the situation to escalate. Plus, it’s become so widespread that it’s hard to manage.&quot;</p><p>If even an S-rank superhuman responded like this, the situation was beyond hopeless.</p><p>&quot;Still, it’s surprising this hasn’t become public. This has happened multiple times, hasn’t it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We’ve compensated them well enough to keep things quiet.&quot;</p><p>Compensation? They attacked public officials—how could that be swept under the rug? What kind of compensation silences something like this?</p><p>&quot;Check the next page for the details,&quot; Han Jiyoon said.</p><p>I flipped to the next page and felt my heart sink.</p><p>&quot;Professor Han… is this a typo?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Seojin. That’s the correct amount.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ten billion? Ten billion per person?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Per person, yes.&quot;</p><p>The worst injury was a fractured bone, but the compensation was ten billion won? For that kind of payout, anyone would gladly break a bone with a smile.</p><p>No wonder it hadn’t gone public. If they’d been stingy, people would’ve raged and exposed it. But with that much money, everyone had every reason to stay silent.</p><p>&quot;I’m truly sorry again. If you feel you can’t handle this….&quot;</p><p>&quot;A civil servant’s job is to make sacrifices for the people. It’s only natural, isn’t it?&quot;</p><p>Call me materialistic, I don’t care. Wouldn’t anyone do the same? Who would refuse ten billion while being told, ‘Get hurt a little, and it’s yours’?</p><p>&quot;Thank you for your understanding. That’s a relief.&quot; Han Jiyoon stood and extended her hand.</p><p>Shaking hands with an S-rank superhuman—something I’d never imagined.</p><p>&quot;Professor, could I get an autograph instead of a handshake?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh… well, sure. Why not? We’ll be working together at the Academy, after all.&quot;</p><p>I handed her my phone case and a few scraps of paper.</p><p>With these, I’d definitely score a few free drinks.</p><p>As Han Jiyoon graciously signed, I activated my perk.</p><p>- Third Eye is activated.</p><p>◎ Han Jiyoon</p><p>The Steadfast Sword</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>An unwavering pillar of strength. Allies gain double courage and composure. Enemies suffer tenfold fatigue. Immovable in extreme situations. Detects deception.</p><p>I probably didn’t need to worry about her.</p><p>&quot;I’ll do my best, Professor Han. And I’m sure this trend will fade soon, especially with you here. Besides, what could possibly happen on my first day?&quot;</p><p>My mouth really is my enemy.</p><p>&quot;Are you ready, Examiner?&quot;</p><p>The moment I stepped into the main building, several students surrounded me. They were Silver rank applicants—or, more accurately, examiner assailants.</p><p>There had to be a mole in the faculty office. How else could my identity have spread so quickly?</p><p>&quot;I’m ready, but… are you sure you’re Bronze?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I showed you earlier. I’m Bronze. If I don’t make Silver, I’m dead meat.&quot;</p><p>If there’s one skill you develop in the Assessment Department, it’s reading people.</p><p>Specifically, gauging their skill level.</p><p>From what I could tell, Park Junwoo, the tattooed thug, was far above my level.</p><p>It was clear he wasn’t a newly enrolled student, either.</p><p>Why him?</p><p>They say you meet your nemesis on a narrow bridge. Of all people, it had to be the guy I’d just encountered earlier. I felt my irritation rising. If I could, I’d punch him. Unfortunately, the chances of me being punched were far higher.</p><p>&quot;Let’s make this quick. It’s my first day.&quot;</p><p>Thankfully, the rank I was assessing was basic. At the Academy, Bronze-to-Silver was equivalent to D- to C-rank. All I needed to do was pass someone, say &quot;Good enough!&quot; and leave.</p><p>&quot;I’d like to give it my all, though.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Park Junwoo just had to make it difficult. Why did it sound like he meant he’d give his all to make me suffer?</p><p>Nothing is ever easy. I might not survive my first day.</p><p>Park Junwoo had even brought his friends to watch. He clearly wanted to use me as a stepping stone for his &quot;achievements.&quot; Sure, the compensation money was sweet, but this was ridiculous.</p><p>&quot;You know the rules, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. Start when you say start, stop when you say stop.&quot;</p><p>If he was this confident, he clearly had the skills to back it up.</p><p>I glanced around and noticed the girl from earlier. Unlike the laughing thugs, she looked genuinely tense.</p><p>- Third Eye is activated.</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>A genius consumed by inferiority.</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>All abilities are temporarily reduced. Prolonged inferiority could result in permanent power loss. Improper development could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p>A genius in despair—it felt like such a contradiction. There was definitely a story there, but I couldn’t place her in the narrative.</p><p>&quot;Let’s begin. I’m ready.&quot;</p><p>Park Junwoo smirked and assumed a stance.</p><p>He was an expert at provoking people. Maybe that was his strategy—to enrage opponents and capitalize on their mistakes. For a thug, he might actually be smart.</p><p>&quot;Alright, let’s start the evaluation.&quot;</p><p>I braced myself, determined to endure. If things got too rough, I’d surrender. At least, that was the plan—</p><p>What the—?</p><p>Before I could react, Park Junwoo was already in front of me. He was faster and stronger than I’d anticipated.</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>&quot;Argh!&quot;</p><p>It felt like I’d been hit by a truck. If I hadn’t blocked, something would’ve definitely broken.</p><p>This was just his raw strength, not even a weapon. I didn’t stand a chance.</p><p>He’s more than qualified for Silver.</p><p>I decided to stop before things got worse. Just as I opened my mouth—</p><p>&quot;Caught off guard, huh?&quot;</p><p>Park Junwoo wasn’t letting me off that easily. His next strike broke through my guard, leaving my vital points exposed.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 3</h1><p>&quot;Haa…&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon exhaled deeply, reclining in her chair.</p><p>An S-rank superhuman, the leader of one of the world’s top five clans—her titles alone rivaled those of national leaders. And yet, here she was, an Academy professor.</p><p>Her presence could be explained by intelligence she’d recently received.</p><p>“The villains’ movements are unusual.”</p><p>When superhumans first emerged, humanity saw them as saviors. For a time, the world forgot one simple truth: humans, when granted power, inevitably desire to wield it.</p><p>Monsters, despite being considered humanity’s enemies, were still just &quot;monsters.&quot; Most were so alien they couldn’t be mistaken for humans.</p><p>Villains, on the other hand, were human. The same species. It was widely accepted that villains, not monsters, posed the greatest threat to humanity.</p><p>&quot;And now, even the ‘Elders’ are on the move,&quot; Han Jiyoon muttered bitterly. Hearing that name again was enough to make her grit her teeth.</p><p>Once comrades, they were now traitors consumed by greed. If only they hadn’t stabbed their allies in the back, things might have been better now.</p><p>“You need to head to the Academy. They need pressure to keep them in check,” the Association President had said, his face unusually tense. Han Jiyoon understood. It was bad enough dealing with regular villains, but the Elders? Even the Superhuman Association couldn’t handle them alone.</p><p>The term “Elder” referred to former S-rank superhumans who had become villains.</p><p>Bzzzt.</p><p>The vibration of her phone interrupted her thoughts. A simple, concise message had arrived:</p><p>[Status?]</p><p>Han Jiyoon sighed, typing her reply.</p><p>[Nothing unusual yet. Quiet for now.]</p><p>[Don’t let your guard down.]</p><p>[When have I ever let my guard down? If you’re so worried, why don’t you come here yourself?]</p><p>[Busy.]</p><p>“This brat. Aren’t you being a little too casual with your older sister?”</p><p>Han Jiyoon resisted the urge to call and scold the sender. She wasn’t the only one dispatched; others were busy too.</p><p>If the Elders were on the move, simultaneous attacks were possible. And while the Academy was critical, there were other facilities just as important to protect.</p><p>“And yet, students are running around recklessly without a shred of responsibility…” Han Jiyoon buried her face in her hands.</p><p>This wasn’t how things had always been. The trend started when superhumans began appearing on TV. They starred in commercials, dramas, and even internet streams. Superhumans became symbols of fame and wealth, their abilities a ticket to a glamorous future.</p><p>Of course, not everyone thought this way. Many students still admired superhumans for their sacrifices, training hard to live up to that ideal. They sweated and bled, fully aware they might lose their lives.</p><p>But even they would eventually realize: No matter how many monsters they defeated or villains they fought, it meant nothing if they didn’t become famous.</p><p>&quot;This can’t go on…&quot; Han Jiyoon muttered.</p><p>Superhumans should carry a sense of responsibility. They shouldn’t be blinded by money and fame. But she couldn’t force them to share her beliefs. That was a matter of personal choice.</p><p>A troubling thought struck her suddenly.</p><p>“Am I turning into a stubborn old nag without realizing it? I’m only in my mid-20s!”</p><p>No way. If she started hearing people calling her old nag, it’d be over. She resolved to maintain an open mind. She didn&#39;t assume she was always right.</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>“Clan Lord… ahem, I mean, Professor.&quot;</p><p>The person who entered was a clan member disguised as an assistant.</p><p>“It’s about the new rank examiner you mentioned earlier.”</p><p>“Oh, Examiner Baek Seojin? What about him?”</p><p>“He just started an evaluation.”</p><p>“Already?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Han Jiyoon sighed, pressing her fingers to her temples. This was why the Academy needed to add ethics and morality to its curriculum.</p><p>Students were eager to show off their abilities, no matter the cost. They acted without hesitation, leaving the aftermath for others to handle.</p><p>The students knew the world would side with them over a lowly civil servant. What could anyone say if they argued, &quot;How can someone so weak evaluate us?&quot;</p><p>The controversy over civil servants gaining bonus points in exams for awakening superpowers had already caused enough backlash. If that civil servant turned out to have barely passable abilities? The media and public would have a field day.</p><p>“Who is it this time?”</p><p>“Park Junwoo.”</p><p>Click, click.</p><p>Han Jiyoon quickly pulled up his profile.</p><p>Park Junwoo. Martial arts type. Entered as a C-rank. Reached the Gold evaluation standard by Academy metrics.</p><p>&quot;…Why is someone eligible for a Gold evaluation taking the Silver test?&quot;</p><p>“You know how it works. If they skip tests or fail to meet standards, they can be demoted. Some abuse the system. They can always climb back up when they feel like it.”</p><p>“These kids nowadays…”</p><p>Han Jiyoon caught herself mid-sentence. Don’t think like that! Don’t turn into an old nag!</p><p>“Anyway, Examiner Baek Seojin… he’s not seriously hurt, is he?”</p><p>Han Jiyoon spoke as if the examiner’s defeat was inevitable.</p><p>It was an unwinnable fight. Why else would someone with awakened powers choose to be a civil servant? It was the difference in talent. Awakening alone wasn’t enough; you needed the potential to grow stronger.</p><p>“And these students all have real combat experience…”</p><p>Superhumans without field experience were seen as useless. Civil servants with superpowers were often treated as such—neither ordinary civilians nor capable operatives.</p><p>“What a shame. He seemed like a decent guy. And he’s not bad-looking either…”</p><p>“Professor?”</p><p>“What is it? Did he get hurt badly?”</p><p>“No, it’s… the opposite.”</p><p>“The opposite?”</p><p>Han Jiyoon blinked in confusion. The assistant continued hesitantly.</p><p>“Park Junwoo lost. Completely. Three of his ribs were broken.”</p><p>“…What?”</p><p>Both Han Jiyoon and her assistant wore identical expressions of disbelief.</p><p>-Third Eye is Activated</p><p>◎ Baek Seojin</p><p>Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>No one can pass without the Gatekeeper’s permission.</p><p>◎ Number Blocked:</p><p>1 ( 1 / 10 )</p><p>The text displayed by Third Eye had changed.</p><p>Until just minutes ago, I was a low-level civil servant.</p><p>“Gatekeeper? The one who blocked me all those times… that’s me now?”</p><p>(TN: he is talking about his game rank that always lose whenever he almost ranked up from bronze to silver)</p><p>The description felt absurd. No one could pass without my permission?</p><p>“Was that strange moment earlier because of this?”</p><p>The sensation from moments ago lingered vividly.</p><p>For a brief instant, I’d read Park Junwoo’s every move.</p><p>The tattooed thug, who couldn’t string together a coherent thought, had at least been skilled.</p><p>“But his movements felt so slow…”</p><p>It was like something out of a superhero movie. He was slow, I was fast. He was weak, I was strong. I evaded his attacks by a hair’s breadth and countered with precision.</p><p>This wasn’t luck. It wasn’t someone else fighting on my behalf. I instinctively knew I’d pushed my abilities to their absolute limit. The overwhelming fatigue afterward was proof of that.</p><p>“Have I ever been like this before?”</p><p>No, I hadn’t. If I had, I wouldn’t have become a civil servant. I’d have joined the Academy myself.</p><p>I’d chosen this life because I had powers but lacked the talent to use them effectively.</p><p>“So, there’s only one explanation.”</p><p>Third Eye—an ability that granted certainty about my opponent’s identity—had changed something within me.</p><p>“Gatekeeper, huh.”</p><p>I didn’t fully understand what had happened. But then again, I didn’t need to.</p><p>After all, had I ever truly understood why I’d become Baek Seojin?</p><p>“Examiner Baek Seojin!”</p><p>The security officer from earlier approached me, looking more urgent than before.</p><p>“That punk, Park Junwoo… he was writhing on the floor earlier. He didn’t actually die, did he?”</p><p>“What’s the situation with Park Junwoo?”</p><p>“Oh, he’s in the infirmary.”</p><p>“And his condition?”</p><p>“They say three ribs are broken.”</p><p>Three broken ribs? That’s serious, isn’t it? Why was the officer speaking as if it were just a scratch?</p><p>“He’s likely resting with painkillers now. By the time he wakes up, his ribs will have healed, so don’t worry.”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>I’d forgotten. This was the Superhuman Academy. Their infirmary could restore severed limbs. Broken ribs were a minor inconvenience.</p><p>“Follow me. There’s somewhere you need to be.”</p><p>Somewhere I needed to be? That sounded ominous. I couldn’t refuse, though. Someone had been injured under my watch. Was I going to be held accountable? Couldn’t they consider the circumstances?</p><p>“I must say, Examiner, I was surprised.”</p><p>“By what?”</p><p>“Park Junwoo. His skill is undeniable. He nearly reached the Academy’s Gold rank in record time after enrolling. And yet, you defeated him in one move.”</p><p>I’d suspected he was skilled, but to that extent? The guy was a full-blown menace. Gold rank meant at least a C-rank superhuman. What had I done to deserve him targeting me?</p><p>“By the way… where are we going?”</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t tell you? My apologies. You’ve been summoned by the Headmaster.”</p><p>The moment the officer mentioned the Headmaster, I let out an involuntary gasp.</p><p>White hair. Half-closed eyes. An elderly figure with an air of mystery. I was about to meet a living embodiment of the &quot;Trinity of Old Age.&quot;</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 4</h1><p>Since the emergence of superhumans, the question has persisted: who is the greatest superhuman in South Korea? If the criteria extend beyond sheer skill or abilities and encompass the individual as a whole, more than half would likely say this name:</p><p>- Third Eye is activated.</p><p>◎ Ma Hakjun</p><p>A Veteran Unfazed by Past Glory</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>Unshackled by his past accomplishments, he remains a formidable figure. Though time has weathered his body, his resilience endures. He does not falter, even in the most extreme circumstances.</p><p>As one of the heroes who saved Korea during the early days of the superhuman crisis, Ma Hakjun’s combat experience ranks among the top ten worldwide.</p><p>Though age eventually pushed him to step away from the frontlines, his class remains unmatched. He commands such respect that no one dares to make an enemy of him.</p><p>It’s said that a white-haired elder with perpetually closed eyes is a terrifying force, no matter where they go.</p><p>That legend now serves as the headmaster of the Academy.</p><p>“This is nerve-wracking.”</p><p>The reason for his sudden summons was likely related to the recent Silver Rank evaluation.</p><p>Even though I was officially dispatched here, I was still an outsider— neither a student nor faculty, not even security personnel.</p><p>Park Junwoo, for all his thuggish behavior, was still an Academy student. It wasn’t hard to guess whose side the headmaster would take.</p><p>“Or maybe… Ma Hakjun might hear me out.”</p><p>I clung to that faint hope as I arrived outside the headmaster’s office. The security officer gestured for me to enter before walking away.</p><p>Before touching the doorknob, I took a deep breath to steady myself.</p><p>“Hoo…”</p><p>Staying calm was easier said than done. Ma Hakjun wasn’t just powerful—he had the character, influence, and skills to back it up. One wrong move, and my life could take a turn for the worse—guaranteed.</p><p>“No. Don’t be intimidated&quot;</p><p>Strictly speaking, I did nothing wrong.</p><p>The lower-level rank evaluations might be considered low-stakes, but superhumans themselves were akin to living weapons. Even in a simple sparring match, a single mistake could lead to severe injuries. For Academy students, such risks were part of their everyday life.</p><p>“You’re going to waste the whole day just holding the doorknob. Come in already.”</p><p>I almost jumped out of my skin. Could he sense my hesitation? The deep voice from beyond the door spurred me into action, and I quickly stepped inside.</p><p>The headmaster’s office wasn’t as grand as its name suggested. There were shelves filled with books, a few framed photographs, various commendations on the walls, and a single, meticulously maintained sword that radiated an imposing aura.</p><p>As I passed these items, I finally came face-to-face with Ma Hakjun.</p><p>“Nice to meet you. You must be the newly dispatched examiner.”</p><p>He looked exactly as described—an elderly man with white hair and perpetually closed eyes.</p><p>At first glance, his appearance sparked debates: was he a hidden villain masking his true intentions or a powerful ally? It didn’t take long for the truth to become clear—he was firmly the latter.</p><p>“It’s an honor to meet you, Headmaster. I’m Baek Seojin, dispatched from the Superpower Assessment Department.”</p><p>“Ma Hakjun.”</p><p>After briefly introducing himself, Ma Hakjun gestured for me to take a seat. Then he simply stared at me in silence.</p><p>There was no hostility in his gaze, but the intensity was enough to make me uncomfortable.</p><p>“Let’s skip the pleasantries and get to the point. I’ll ask you one question. Answer it once, and only once.”</p><p>Even the way he spoke was heavy with pressure. Was he angry about the injury to the student?</p><p>“Why are you here at the Academy?”</p><p>“…Pardon?”</p><p>I instinctively repeated his question. It made no sense. Why was I here?</p><p>“Headmaster, I… I’m not sure I understand—”</p><p>“I said I’d ask only once. You only get one chance to answer.”</p><p>This was Ma Hakjun. Even if age had caught up with him, he was still one of the greatest superhumans. He wasn’t the type to joke or ask frivolous questions.</p><p>His tone and expression made it clear he was completely serious. He wanted a truthful answer.</p><p>“I… uh….”</p><p>The problem was, I didn’t have a good answer for him.</p><p>“Well… I was told to come, so here I am.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun didn’t reply immediately. He simply stared at me with an even sharper gaze than before.</p><p>“That’s your answer?”</p><p>When he finally spoke, his tone was cold, and I reflexively nodded. The saying, “Class is eternal,” couldn’t be more true. His mere presence was overwhelming.</p><p>“…Very well. If that’s your answer.” Ma Hakjun nodded, clearing his throat.</p><p>“I heard there was a minor incident during the rank evaluation.”</p><p>“Ah, Headmaster, about that—”</p><p>“Don’t dwell on it. Park Junwoo likely knew what he was getting into.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun was known for deeply caring about the Academy and its students. I’d feared he might scold me for injuring one, but—</p><p>“He got what was coming to him. I figured he’d face a harsh lesson sooner or later.”</p><p>As expected, Ma Hakjun was different.</p><p>From his reaction, it seemed he already had a good grasp of Park Junwoo’s character.</p><p>“I’ll ensure the matter is handled appropriately, so it doesn’t cause issues with the higher-ups.”</p><p>“Thank you, Headmaster. Truly, thank you.”</p><p>“Brace yourself for more trouble. This incident will draw even more students to you.”</p><p>He was probably right.</p><p>The idea of a previously unassuming lower-rank examiner defeating a capable student like Park Junwoo would surely attract attention—some curious, others malicious.</p><p>“But not all students are like that. Most of them are decent. I wanted to tell you this so you wouldn’t judge them too harshly.”</p><p>Of course, Headmaster. I understand better than anyone.</p><p>The real troublemakers were a minority. Most students genuinely wanted to fulfill their duties as superhumans. It was just that the troublemakers stood out like sore thumbs.</p><p>“Keep up the good work.”</p><p>“Thank you, Headmaster. I’ll take my leave now.”</p><p>The conversation was brief but left a lasting impression. As expected of one of the greatest allies one could have.</p><p>…</p><p>“Hm…” Ma Hakjun closed his eyes, replaying the conversation in his mind.</p><p>“Well… I was told to come, so here I am.”</p><p>Baek Seojin, the newly dispatched examiner. On paper, he was just an ordinary civil servant.</p><p>But the events of Park Junwoo’s evaluation were anything but ordinary.</p><p>“His skills aren’t normal. He baited his opponent into letting their guard down and ended the fight in a single blow.”</p><p>Even from the written report, Ma Hakjun could picture the scene vividly. This wasn’t the behavior of a typical assessment department employee. Something was being concealed, whether intentionally or not.</p><p>Ma Hakjun considered two possibilities:</p><p>The first was that Baek Seojin might be a spy for the villains targeting the Academy.</p><p>Given his skills, it wasn’t entirely implausible.</p><p>Ma Hakjun knew the capabilities of the Assessment Department better than anyone. Someone of Baek Seojin’s level wouldn’t be assigned to a desk job. If he had that kind of talent, he’d be on the frontlines.</p><p>“If he’s a rookie spy, he might accidentally expose his powers while trying to blend in. And given reports of villains moving in the shadows, it’s not far-fetched.”</p><p>The second possibility was that Baek Seojin had been sent by that friend.</p><p>“Forty years I’ve spent calling that fool my friend, and this is what it comes to.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun sighed, massaging his temples.</p><p>He had recently been enduring pleas that were almost desperate in nature.</p><p>“Please, Hakjun, I’m begging you. Keep an eye on my granddaughter. Make sure she doesn’t get mixed up with the wrong crowd. She’s a fragile girl, you see. I can’t sleep at night worrying about her.”</p><p>Kang Minsung—a hero who had saved Korea from destruction alongside Ma Hakjun. The head of a prestigious superhuman family renowned for their weaponry-based abilities. An overwhelming presence on the battlefield, feared even by villains.</p><p>Yet, in private, Kang Minsung was an overprotective grandfather prone to outbursts.</p><p>Kang Minsung’s granddaughter had recently enrolled at the Academy.</p><p>“She has decent abilities but struggles with inferiority and self-doubt.”</p><p>It made sense. Kang Minsung’s children and grandchildren had all inherited his talent and fame.</p><p>In such a family, merely being “decent” could feel like a failure.</p><p>The pressure to live up to the family name had likely crushed her confidence. It was no surprise that she became withdrawn—and that others took advantage of her vulnerability.</p><p>One of those opportunists had been Park Junwoo. And today, Park Junwoo had been utterly defeated.</p><p>It was no wonder Ma Hakjun suspected Baek Seojin might be one of Kang Minsung’s agents, sent to protect her.</p><p>But the sincerity in Baek Seojin’s voice and eyes… they weren’t those of someone hiding the truth.</p><p>There was one more possibility:</p><p>Baek Seojin was exactly what he appeared to be—a nobody who had gotten lucky.</p><p>“Perhaps it was sheer instinct or a miraculous survival response.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun decided on one course of action:</p><p>“Keep an eye on him.”</p><p>If Baek Seojin turned out to be a villain’s pawn, he’d deal with it. If Kang Minsung had sent him, Ma Hakjun would send him back with a stern warning. And if Baek Seojin really was just a lucky civil servant…</p><p>“He could inspire the students in a positive way.”</p><p>No matter the case, it would take time to uncover the truth. In the meantime, Ma Hakjun cleared his desk, organizing the reports.</p><p>- Baek Seojin, Male, 24, Support Type, Superpower Assessment Department, Assigned to Academy.</p><p>- Park Junwoo, Male, 22, Martial Arts Type, Entered as C-rank, Eligible for Gold Rank Evaluation.</p><p>As he reached a particular file, Ma Hakjun clicked his tongue.</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>That damned fool. As much as he wanted to ignore his old friend’s request, he couldn’t entirely disregard it.</p><p>Ma Hakjun muttered to himself as he reviewed the details again.</p><p>- Kim Suhyeon, Female, 20, Weaponry Type, Entered as E-rank, Bronze Rank by Academy Standards.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 5</h1><p>Ma Hakjun’s worries had not been misplaced. The moment I left the headmaster’s office and returned to the main hall, students swarmed toward me.</p><p>“Examiner! I’d like to apply for the Silver rank evaluation!”</p><p>“I got here first! I’m in big trouble if I don’t pass this time!”</p><p>There were almost ten of them. A quick glance told me their abilities were on par with Park Junwoo’s.</p><p>“These bastards, huh?”</p><p>The rumor that Park Junwoo got thoroughly beaten by the Silver rank examiner must’ve spread like wildfire. Given his thug-like behavior, it was no surprise that he had more enemies than allies.</p><p>It seemed they had gathered to take me down and solidify their positions in the Silver rank. And if they succeeded, it would give them ample opportunity to mock Park Junwoo. I was certain of this, especially after activating the Third Eye.</p><p>Opportunists. Attention seekers. Glory hounds. Every single one of them was here to exploit Park Junwoo’s defeat.</p><p>“Not a single decent one in the bunch.”</p><p>Now I understood why Han Jiyoon and Ma Hakjun were so concerned.</p><p>These students didn’t represent the Academy as a whole, but their actions could easily cast a shadow over it. It would take just a handful of them to sully the reputation of the many diligent students preparing to become superhumans.</p><p>It was disheartening to see these so-called future heroes behaving like this. I wanted to tell them all to get lost, but that wasn’t an option. After all, I was here as a government-dispatched examiner. A public servant, funded by taxpayers, representing the assessment department.</p><p>“Line up and prepare yourselves. We’ll begin the evaluations immediately.”</p><p>- The Third Eye is Activated.</p><p>◎ Baek Seojin</p><p>Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>No one can pass without the Gatekeeper’s permission.</p><p>◎ Number Blocked:</p><p>1 ( 1 / 10 )</p><p>Nothing had changed since the moment I faced Park Junwoo. That same sharp awareness lingered in my body, urging me forward. I could do this. I could take on Academy students and hold my ground.</p><p>“Here I go! Haaaah!”</p><p>The first challenger was a weapon specialist. He chose a simple wooden training sword. Though it wasn’t a real blade, even a wooden sword could cause serious injury. In the past, I would have instinctively stepped back. Now, I knew without a doubt that moving forward was the right call.</p><p>I lowered my body and pushed off powerfully, closing the gap between us. The wooden sword whizzed past my ear, just barely missing me.</p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p>The student’s face showed visible panic. He had likely started with his strongest move, fully expecting it to work. As he tried to adjust his stance, his footwork faltered, leaving an opening. I stepped forward again, exploiting that fleeting moment.</p><p>“Evaluation failed.”</p><p>Tap, tap—</p><p>With two light taps to his neck, the student staggered back, groaning. His wide eyes screamed disbelief. He probably thought victory was a given. But in reality, his skills were only marginally better than Park Junwoo’s.</p><p>“Next.”</p><p>Not even a bead of sweat. My body felt lighter than ever. For a moment, I wondered if I should quit my desk job and head to the field instead.</p><p>It wasn’t just my body that had changed. Before stepping into the Academy, I had regarded these students as something beyond my reach. They were the elite, future heroes under government management. Now, that unconscious sense of inferiority was gone.</p><p>“You’re pretty good, Examiner.”</p><p>The next challenger was from the martial arts division. His stance exuded confidence. His face had lost its earlier smirk, replaced by cold determination.</p><p>“Not that it’ll change anything.”</p><p>As expected, he attacked first.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A spinning kick aimed directly at me. The sound it made was enough to make my heart skip a beat. I knew I had to block it. Or did I?</p><p>Something inside told me there was no need to take it head-on. With a slight twist of my upper body, I dodged the kick by a hair.Before my opponent could launch another move, I targeted his supporting leg.</p><p>“Gah!”</p><p>A firm stomp to his unguarded left thigh. It wouldn’t break the bone, but it would leave a nasty bruise.</p><p>“Next student.”</p><p>At that point, the enthusiasm of the challengers began to waver. Some were already backing away, likely considering abandoning the evaluation.</p><p>“Oh no, you’re not leaving. Coming here was your choice, but leaving? That’s up to me.”</p><p>…</p><p>“How many has he beaten now?”</p><p>“Eight in a row.”</p><p>“And he hasn’t taken a single break?”</p><p>“Is he really just a Silver rank examiner?”</p><p>The murmurs from the observing students grew louder. Initially, they must have thought I was just another weak examiner waiting to be humiliated. But with every challenger defeated, it was clear something wasn’t adding up.</p><p>&quot;All of them were at least Silver rank, with some nearing Gold-level proficiency.&quot;</p><p>It wasn’t like I had no experience in this field. My ability, categorized under the support type, specialized in detection and measurement.</p><p>Those guys had intentionally avoided rank evaluations to drop down to Bronze. They had the skills to climb back up whenever they wanted, which was why they could afford to pull off stunts like this.</p><p>&quot;Next.&quot;</p><p>Of course, they couldn’t have predicted the situation would turn out like this. I understood their shock. I hadn’t expected things to unfold this way either.</p><p>- The Third Eye is Activated.</p><p>◎ Baek Seojin</p><p>Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>No one can pass without the Gatekeeper’s permission.</p><p>◎ Number Blocked:</p><p>9 ( 9 / 10 )</p><p>Nine down. Just one more to reach ten.</p><p>I had no idea what would happen when I hit that milestone, but I doubted it would be bad. If it were, the Third Eye would have issued some sort of warning.</p><p>“Is there anyone else?”</p><p>“Right here, Examiner.”</p><p>A lone male student stepped forward from the group, raising his hand. He was different from the others—no arrogance, no swagger.</p><p>“Pleasure to meet you, Examiner Baek Seojin. I’m Lee Hyunwoo, Bronze rank.”</p><p>His introduction was met with snickers from the other students. It seemed he was a genuine Bronze rank, unlike the others who had intentionally fallen to that level.</p><p>“Wait… did he just say Hyunwoo?”</p><p>As soon as I processed his name, I felt a chill run down my spine.</p><p>- The Third Eye Activated.</p><p>◎ Lee Hyunwoo</p><p>The Master of Effort Beyond Talent</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>Loves extreme training. Will one day surpass everyone. Training effects are doubled. Training fatigue is halved.</p><p>“No doubt about it. It’s him.”</p><p>I double-checked the Third Eye, and the result was the same.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo. The “Master of Effort Beyond Talent.” The protagonist of the original story.</p><p>“That’s right… Hyunwoo started as a Bronze too.”</p><p>This guy would skyrocket to Diamond rank within a year.</p><p>He would slay monsters, defeat villains, and grow stronger with every battle. Calling him a sponge wasn’t an exaggeration—his efforts knew no bounds.</p><p>But for now, he was just a Bronze-ranked student, ridiculed by his peers.</p><p>“Sorry, Hyunwoo. You won’t be making Silver today.”</p><p>For a moment, I considered letting him win. As the protagonist, he was bound to have the story’s favor on his side.</p><p>But then I dismissed the thought.</p><p>Who was I now? A rookie from the Assessment Department?

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 6</h1><p>Every time the black flames met the sword, waves of heat scattered in all directions. The intense waves of magical energy, so powerful they sent chills down the spine, carried a thick aura of murderous intent.</p><p>The entire area had already been reduced to ruins. Wounded students lay scattered everywhere. They needed saving. They needed care. They were still fragile seedlings. If more time was wasted, countless lives would be lost.</p><p>But Han Jiyoon had no capacity to help them.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s this? Why are you so weak?&quot;</p><p>A shadowy figure wavered before morphing into a massive sword, poised to drop over Han Jiyoon&#39;s head like an executioner&#39;s blade.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>&quot;Ugh!&quot;</p><p>A woman who had once disappeared, consumed by hatred and curses for the world and humanity. Even back then, she had seemed ready to unleash her honed killing intent at any moment. Now she had returned, her murderous aura even stronger.</p><p>Once a comrade and a hero, she had become a traitor to humanity.</p><p>An Elder.</p><p>&quot;Our little Jiyoon, your skills have really dulled, huh? Is that all there is to your sword dance?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my, is that how you talk to your elder sister?&quot;</p><p>Grinding her teeth, Han Jiyoon&#39;s sword flared with blue energy, slicing through the surrounding shadows.</p><p>The previously relaxed woman casually stepped back, her shadow splitting apart and dissolving on the ground.</p><p>&quot;Too bad! If you&#39;d swung just a little harder, you might have sliced off this big sister&#39;s head.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said shut up. And stop calling yourself my sister. One more time, and I&#39;ll kill you, Hyun Sujin.&quot;</p><p>Hyun Sujin. Once an S-rank superhuman like Han Jiyoon. Once, a comrade.</p><p>In the early days, she was brighter and more righteous than anyone else. A person they could all rely on. She was like a holy figure in a magical world.</p><p>But after getting involved in a certain incident, she grew to despise the world and its people. Eventually, she chose to become a nightmare instead of humanity&#39;s beacon of hope.</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t just talk tough. Try harder. You&#39;re not even using half your strength.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Half is more than enough for the likes of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lies. Do you think I don&#39;t know? I know exactly what&#39;s on your mind.&quot;</p><p>Hyun Sujin casually flicked her pinky finger.</p><p>In that instant, a student&#39;s body floated into the air.</p><p>&quot;If you keep getting distracted, I might just kill them all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You... damn it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aw, thanks for the compliment. I&#39;m touched to tears!&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon bit her lip until it bled, scanning the area.</p><p>It was always the same.</p><p>Now, Hyun Sujin was using the same tactic on people.</p><p>And knowing her, she&#39;d follow through on every word she spoke.</p><p>&quot;You seem to be holding back because you&#39;re worried about them... I warned you, Jiyoon.&quot;</p><p>Smiling brightly, like a demon risen from hell, Hyun Sujin whispered.</p><p>&quot;If you don&#39;t fight properly, I&#39;ll tear them apart piece by piece.&quot;</p><p>Grinding her teeth, Han Jiyoon had no viable options.</p><p>If she used her full strength as Hyun Sujin wanted, the injured students would be caught in the crossfire. But dragging out the fight would only tempt Hyun Sujin to act on her threats.</p><p>There was only one choice: buy time until reinforcements arrived. Thankfully, the headmaster wasn&#39;t far away.</p><p>&quot;I told you, I can see exactly what you&#39;re thinking.&quot;</p><p>Hovering in the air, Hyun Sujin giggled.</p><p>&quot;If you&#39;re waiting for that old man Ma Hakjun, don&#39;t bother. You think we&#39;re stupid? Of course, we&#39;ve accounted for him. We&#39;ve matched forces exactly to his level, so it&#39;ll take him a while.&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon froze mid-curse. Something felt off in Hyun Sujin&#39;s words.</p><p>At first, she thought it was a simple ambush. A mission to destroy the Academy. But now Hyun Sujin said they just needed to buy some time.</p><p>&#39;Not to assassinate the headmaster, but merely to delay him?&#39;</p><p>There were other oddities too.</p><p>Despite urging Han Jiyoon to fight seriously, Hyun Sujin herself wasn&#39;t using her full power. She was holding back, deliberately prolonging the fight.</p><p>As if to say, &quot;You need to stay here and play with me for a long, long time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You had another plan, didn&#39;t you? This isn&#39;t just a simple attack.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my! Jiyoon&#39;s getting sharp! I&#39;m so moved I could cry.&quot;</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Shadows morphed into dark blades, aiming for Han Jiyoon&#39;s shoulder. They were almost invisible, but Han Jiyoon blocked them with ease.</p><p>Once again, Hyun Sujin hadn&#39;t used her full strength.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re impressive. So, as a reward, I&#39;ll share something with you. Villains love monologuing about their plans, right? I&#39;ve always wanted to try that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard a very precious gemstone just enrolled here.&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon instinctively understood what she meant.</p><p>By &quot;gemstone,&quot; she meant one of the newly admitted students.</p><p>&quot;Some fools say they&#39;re worthless, but we saw the potential. The condensed, violent brilliance inside them! So we&#39;re going to take it. Break through the Academy&#39;s defenses and steal it... just like a phantom thief.&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon&#39;s mind raced. Who was this student? Who was worth sending even an Elder to kidnap?</p><p>Then it hit her.</p><p>A girl from a prestigious family, yet lacking overwhelming talent. Someone dismissed as a failure.</p><p>&quot;The granddaughter of Kang Minseong, right? Ah, I can&#39;t wait! How will that doting old man react when he hears his precious granddaughter was kidnapped? What will he say to Ma Hakjun? What reckless things will he do? I&#39;m dying to know!&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon bit her lip again.</p><p>Would the professors hold out until reinforcements came?</p><p>But before she could hope, Hyun Sujin smirked.</p><p>&quot;Oh, Jiyoon. You didn&#39;t think I came alone, did you?&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon&#39;s eyes widened.</p><p>&quot;Surely you didn&#39;t think we&#39;d pull this off with just one Elder, right?&quot;</p><p>The Elders had never moved in pairs before. They were the kind who couldn&#39;t cooperate, let alone harmonize. That’s why the Association, Han Jiyoon herself, and even Ma Hakjun had all let their guard down.</p><p>&quot;You finally look flustered, huh? Hehe. Jiyoon, let’s make a bet. Here’s the deal. If you do me a little favor, I’ll step aside. I won’t bother you anymore. How about it?&quot;</p><p>With a sly smile, Hyun Sujin slowly raised her hand.</p><p>&quot;The condition of the bet is simple. Kill this student with your own hands.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hyun Sujin!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not much time to think about it, you know? Time’s ticking away, Jiyoon! Tick-tock, tick-tock!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kim Suhyeon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-no! I’m not Kim Suhyeon…!&quot;</p><p>Stab!</p><p>Instead of a reply, a spear pierced through the girl&#39;s stomach. With a harsh cough, dark red blood spilled from her lips as her body went limp.</p><p>The man holding the spear looked like a corpse dragged from a river. His complexion was deathly pale, and water dripped from his entire body. Dragging one leg behind him, he continued his slow search.</p><p>&quot;Kim Suhyeon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;S-She went that way! Just over there!&quot;</p><p>At the boy’s panicked shout, the man slowly turned his body.</p><p>Security guards and professors tried to block his path, but a single thrust ended them.</p><p>It was impossible for an ordinary superhuman to stand against an Elder.</p><p>Dragging his body forward, the man spotted a girl and spoke.</p><p>&quot;...Found you.&quot;</p><p>There it was. Exactly what he was searching for—what someone else desperately wanted. He just wanted to end this quickly and escape this repulsive place.</p><p>&quot;A-ahh!&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon must have sensed she was in grave danger.</p><p>She turned and fled, but an injury from an earlier explosion slowed her down. No matter how hard she ran, the distance between her and the man with the spear shrank.</p><p>Huff! Huff!</p><p>The more she moved, the more blood she lost. The bleeding gradually made her limbs heavy and sluggish.</p><p>&quot;Please help me! Someone, please save me!&quot;</p><p>She screamed for help, but no response came.</p><p>Terrified. Completely terrified. The man with the spear seemed like a ghost. Dripping with the aura of death, he dragged his leg closer and closer.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>&quot;Ahk!&quot;</p><p>Was it the blood loss? Her legs gave out, and she collapsed. Looking back, the man was right there. Close enough to touch.</p><p>Swish—</p><p>Suddenly, Kim Suhyeon felt herself being yanked forward. Between her and the spear-wielding phantom, a man stepped in.</p><p>&quot;Move.&quot;</p><p>The ghostly figure leveled his spear and spoke in a chilling tone. If you step aside, you won’t die. So get out of the way. It was his first and final offer to let someone live.</p><p>But—</p><p>&quot;Sorry. I don’t think I can do that.&quot;</p><p>The man standing in his way flatly refused the offer.</p>"

Between the flames, smoke, and debris, the screams of students echoed.</p><p>This was the event that marked the opening chapter of the novel: the villain&#39;s attack on the academy. If memory served correctly, there were supposedly two Elders among them.</p><p>The academy&#39;s defenses were nearly flawless, but they were meaningless before the Elders. Considering that the Elders were once S-rank superhumans, this was only natural.</p><p>Their combat instincts, their abilities—every aspect of them was overwhelming. No matter how many faculty members and security personnel there were, they couldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p><p>Even with Han Jiyoon around… stopping a single Elder is the best she can do.</p><p>Honestly, I wanted to turn and run without looking back. After all, I was just someone temporarily assigned here.</p><p>Unlike the faculty or security officers, I had no obligation to protect the students. No one would blame me for abandoning my post and fleeing. Yes. I could run. I should just run without hesitation…</p><p>&quot;Shit.&quot;</p><p>But my own conscience wouldn&#39;t let me. That principle of mine ended up holding me back. I&#39;m a public servant paid by the taxes of the people. It&#39;s only right that I earn that pay when those very people are in danger. Besides, when people are screaming for help right in front of me, it&#39;s only natural to step in.</p><p>&quot;Students! This way! Come this way!&quot;</p><p>Flames were rising everywhere, but the most severe fires were concentrated around the main building. That must be where the most dangerous enemies were advancing from. I led the students toward the opposite side, where the theory classrooms were located.</p><p>I just needed to hold out for a little while. By now, this chaos must have been reported outside. Reinforcements would arrive soon. And here, we had Han Jiyoon and Ma Hakjun. Soon enough, they&#39;d drive the villains away. I just needed to endure until then.</p><p>&quot;Kyaaah!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uwaah!!&quot;</p><p>While I was evacuating people, panicked screams erupted from one side. Several students appeared, covered in blood.</p><p>I was about to call them over to safety when—</p><p>Zzzt—</p><p>A sharp sensation, as if needles pricked every inch of my skin. Someone was approaching through the flames and smoke.</p><p>At first, I thought it was another injured student. Their appearance was wretched, and they were dragging a leg.</p><p>But the moment I saw the ominous air around them and the blood-soaked spear in their hand, I realized—</p><p>- Activating the Third Eye. -</p><p>◎ Kwak Hyuk</p><p>The One Who Died in Arrogance</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>⚠️ Warning – Dangerous Individual</p><p>⚠️ Warning – Dangerous Individual</p><p>⚠️ Warning – Dangerous Individual</p><p>…I&#39;m screwed.</p><p>I remembered. That ghostly figure, soaked as if drowned, dragging a leg, wielding a spear.</p><p>Nothing about him was clearly known. Some said he was betrayed, others claimed he was an experimental subject who escaped. No one knew for sure. Whether he was truly betrayed or subjected to experiments.</p><p>But one thing was certain. The man approaching was an Elder. Without being an S-rank superhuman, defeating him was utterly impossible.</p><p>&quot;Help me!&quot;</p><p>Maybe if I ran away now without looking back, I could survive. That thought briefly crossed my mind when I heard a strangely familiar voice.</p><p>A female student was crawling away desperately in front of the Elder. Her face was familiar. She was the student who had apologized to me earlier.</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>If it were a complete stranger, I might have turned away. But realizing she was someone I had met today—even briefly—made me pause.</p><p>What do I do? What should I do?</p><p>There was still some distance between the Elder and the girl. Though the gap was narrowing, if I sprinted at full speed, I might be able to save her.</p><p>That split-second hesitation felt like an eternity.</p><p>The Elder ignored everything else and advanced solely toward the girl. As I debated, standing between the pleading girl and the looming Elder—</p><p>◎ Warning</p><p>An unqualified individual is attempting to cross the sacred Silver threshold.</p><p>- Silver Gatekeeper trait forcibly activated. -</p><p>At first, I didn&#39;t understand what that meant. But then, a hypothesis flashed through my mind.</p><p>…No way.</p><p>This was the very spot where the Silver advancement test had been taking place. The incident broke out right when I was about to test Lee Hyunwoo. In other words, the approaching Elder had trespassed into the examination grounds without permission.</p><p>Step— Step—</p><p>I began to walk forward, one step at a time. The thought of running away faded. The fear of dying flickered but quickly vanished.</p><p>I didn’t know where this confidence was coming from. Maybe I was just crazy. Completely insane.</p><p>But ignoring someone I had briefly met… That didn’t sit right with me.</p><p>&quot;Move.&quot;</p><p>Before I knew it, I was standing between the girl and the Elder.</p><p>An underqualified superhuman blocking an Elder? Unless I had a death wish, this was unthinkable.</p><p>I glanced at the Elder.</p><p>Cold sweat dripped down my back.</p><p>The figure was terrifying beyond words. His appearance was horrific, but the ominous aura surrounding him was far worse. Blood, dripping from the spear, carried the screams of the dead.</p><p>So this is what it feels like to face death itself.</p><p>&quot;Move.&quot;</p><p>The Elder spoke again without even glancing at me. His eyes were fixed solely on the girl behind me—Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>In that moment, pieces of information clicked in my mind.</p><p>A genius consumed by inferiority. Villain invasion. A girl the Elder was obsessed with.</p><p>…I see. I get it now. That girl, Kim Suhyeon, is the ‘Crimson Witch’!</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo’s first moment of glory had been during this villain assault. Fighting fiercely despite injuries, standing out as the true protagonist.</p><p>On that very day, a female student was kidnapped and brainwashed into becoming a villain. Her ruthless nature and overwhelming power earned her the code name Crimson Witch.</p><p>She would later become the protagonist’s worst enemy, relentlessly tormenting him and his allies.</p><p>I didn’t recognize her since the name wasn’t mentioned, but… Kim Suhyeon is the Crimson Witch! It’s her!</p><p>Now I had one more reason to step up.</p><p>The Crimson Witch was infamous for her brutality. Wherever she appeared, only corpses remained—no survivors. Eventually, she would invade Seoul, causing over 500,000 deaths.</p><p>And now, the Elder was here to take Kim Suhyeon. If I stepped aside now, I’d be handing over hundreds of thousands of lives. Knowing that and still turning away… that wouldn’t make me human.</p><p>◎ Warning</p><p>An unqualified individual is attempting to cross the sacred Silver threshold.</p><p>- Silver Gatekeeper trait forcibly activated. -</p><p>And this constant warning was also weighing on my mind.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>Yeah. I don’t know anymore. There was only one answer.</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t let you pass.&quot;</p><p>I glanced back at Kim Suhyeon. With a nod, I signaled toward the group of students gathering nearby.</p><p>&quot;Ah...&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon instinctively tried to run but stopped and looked at me. She wasn’t the Crimson Witch yet, so she still had a human heart. She hesitated. She felt guilty. Her expression seemed to ask if it was okay to leave like this.</p><p>&quot;Hurry up and go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes...!&quot;</p><p>As I turned my head, my eyes met the ghost’s. That cowardly instinct crept back up. I should&#39;ve ignored this. Why did I step in?</p><p>&quot;Move.&quot;</p><p>As if confirming my hesitation, the ghost slowly parted his lips. I instinctively knew this would be his final warning. And unfortunately, I had only one answer to give.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see.&quot;</p><p>The moment he heard my answer, the ghost raised his spear with full force. Only then did I realize the madness of what I had done.</p><p>To show this kind of defiance in front of an Elder… I must have completely lost my mind.</p><p>BOOM—!!</p><p>&quot;Uaaaaah!!&quot;</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo let out a desperate scream as he took down yet another villain. Breathing heavily, he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>The academy was already a wasteland. Flames and smoke shot up everywhere, making it hard to distinguish friend from foe. Even the students who barely escaped the hellish chaos were still fighting the villains.</p><p>&quot;Injured students, retreat immediately! Weapon and martial arts divisions, don&#39;t fall back!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Support division, gather here! We need to treat the wounded immediately!!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The fire&#39;s spreading! Magic division, we need water spells now!!&quot;</p><p>At first, everyone was in a complete panic, but they quickly composed themselves and resumed their duties.</p><p>The students formed defensive lines centered around their evacuation points. The combat divisions fought off the villains, while the others cared for the injured. Soon, the remaining professors and security personnel joined in, strengthening the defense line.</p><p>Until that man—looking like a drowned corpse—appeared.</p><p>BOOM—!!</p><p>The man limped forward after blasting away the examiner who blocked his path. His approach was slow, painfully slow, yet it felt like the embodiment of inevitable death.</p><p>&quot;Students! Fall back immediately!&quot;</p><p>The professors urgently ordered the students to retreat. Lee Hyunwoo saw it—the fear on their faces.</p><p>These were professors who were B-rank or even A-rank superhumans. Veterans with countless real-world combat experiences under their belts. Yet even they were gritting their teeth, filled with tension.</p><p>&quot;Hey! Are you okay?&quot;</p><p>Nearby, a female student was supporting another injured girl. Her leg was severely wounded, and her face was ghostly pale from blood loss.</p><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s... it&#39;s my fault. I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;</p><p>The girl who barely escaped with her life sobbed uncontrollably, apologizing over and over.</p><p>&quot;We have a severely injured student here! Please, treat her quickly!&quot;</p><p>Even as she was carried away, she kept muttering apologies without end. Watching her for a moment, Lee Hyunwoo turned his gaze forward.</p><p>Even as a mere Bronze-ranked student, he could vaguely sense it. The man approaching now was a monster. No, something far worse.</p><p>Everyone here will die. Without even a chance to scream, they will all be slaughtered.</p><p>&quot;...&quot;</p><p>But then, the approaching man paused and slowly turned his body.</p><p>After a moment of silence, he let out something between a sigh and a sneer.</p><p>&quot;...What are you?&quot;</p><p>From between the flames and the wreckage, someone was crawling out. Slowly standing up, the figure looked terrible. His entire body was drenched in blood, and one shoulder dangled as if dislocated.</p><p>&quot;Me?&quot;</p><p>Yet, his eyes burned brighter than the surrounding flames.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m the Silver-Rank Examiner.&quot;</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 8</h1><p>I thought I was going to die. I was just an ordinary superhuman, and the opponent was an Elder. But for some reason, when I opened my eyes, I could still see the burning academy. I had expected my limbs to be shattered, but I could still move my arms and legs.</p><p>◎ Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>— Trait is currently active.</p><p>The only reason I survived must be because of this trait. It was so absurd that I couldn’t help but let out a laugh.</p><p>I know all too well from experience— A gatekeeper never lets anyone through. No matter what, they hold on and drag down whoever tries to pass. I fell to my knees 99 times because of that. And now, I’ve become that very gatekeeper.</p><p>“Ugh...”</p><p>As I stood up, a groan escaped on its own. My shoulder throbbed painfully, likely dislocated. In movies and dramas, people somehow pop it back in themselves, but... Damn it. I can’t do it. It hurts way too much. This isn’t something a normal person can do.</p><p>“What are you?”</p><p>Barely managing to take a step, I noticed the Elder staring straight at me. He must’ve realized I wasn’t dead.</p><p>Can’t you just pretend not to notice?</p><p>I sighed internally, but it was do-or-die now. My trait was still active, and somehow, I had survived the Elder’s attack. If I could survive the first strike, maybe I could survive the second.</p><p>...Honestly, that was wishful thinking, but I had no other choice.</p><p>“It’s me.”</p><p>So I just went for it.</p><p>“I’m the Silver-Rank Examiner.”</p><p>At my answer, the Elder tilted his head, then slowly approached me, gripping his spear. Professors, students, even Kim Suhyeon—he didn’t spare them a glance. His eyes were locked solely on me as he closed in.</p><p>I wanted to run. I desperately wanted to stay alive. It wasn’t just fear. I simply didn’t want to be in pain anymore.</p><p>They say pain makes a person cowardly, and it’s true. I didn’t want to hurt anymore. I felt like I was dying already. I lost count of how many times I wanted to kneel and beg for my life.</p><p>But every time that temptation crept in, this thought held me back:</p><p>If I let this Elder pass me, what happens then? What will happen to Kim Suhyeon, and the 500,000 innocent people she will eventually kill?</p><p>Could I sleep peacefully knowing that?</p><p>Damn it...</p><p>If I hadn’t known, I might’ve turned a blind eye. But knowing what comes after, I couldn’t run away.</p><p>I wasn’t some hero wannabe or a hidden powerhouse. I knew this was a fight I was guaranteed to lose.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>With that, the world seemed to turn pitch black, and I spun through the air. I didn’t even have time to feel pain. My mind couldn’t process what was happening.</p><p>“Guh! Cough! Ugh!”</p><p>I couldn’t breathe properly. Every bone in my body felt like it was breaking. When I finally looked around, I realized I had been slammed into debris again by the Elder’s spear strike.</p><p>I really thought I was going to die this time, but I survived again. It hurt like hell, but I managed to endure. Somehow, my dislocated shoulder had popped back in from the impact. Should I call that lucky? It was so ridiculous I almost laughed.</p><p>“…What are you?”</p><p>The Elder approached me again, this time with a hint of confusion in his voice. Understandable. A mere superhuman had survived two of his attacks. If I were him, I’d be curious too.</p><p>“Cough! Didn’t you hear me before? Cough, cough. I said I’m the examiner.”</p><p>I survived the second attack. Even though I felt like dying, a strange confidence began to stir inside me. Without thinking, I ended up speaking with a hint of defiance.</p><p>The Elder raised his spear again but hesitated.</p><p>He was conflicted—he wanted to toy with me out of curiosity, but he had a mission to complete.</p><p>I can’t let him go. If Kim Suhyeon gets taken, it’s all over.</p><p>Forcing my trembling legs to move, I stood up. I had to stop him here. I couldn’t let him pass.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon, and the 500,000 innocent lives at stake. I had to grit my teeth and endure one more time.</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Perhaps deciding to focus on his mission, the Elder turned his body away, heading toward where Kim Suhyeon had fled. I had to stop him. I needed to provoke him.</p><p>“Running away?”</p><p>Yeah, if he ignored that, he wouldn’t be a monster.</p><p>At my words, the Elder slowly turned back to face me. His gaze alone felt like it was tearing me apart, but I forced myself to stand firm. If I backed down now, it would be worse than doing nothing.</p><p>“…What a shame.”</p><p>What’s a shame?</p><p>“I wanted to learn more about you… slowly.”</p><p>Wooooong—!</p><p>A grotesque hum resonated from the Elder’s spear. If that hit me, I’d die. Gatekeeper or not, I would truly die.</p><p>I needed to dodge, but damn it—my body wouldn’t move. Was it fear that froze me, or was I simply at my limit? No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t even lift a finger.</p><p>I thought this was the end. I wondered what would happen after I died.</p><p>“Hyup!!”</p><p>At that moment, a sharp battle cry echoed, and someone suddenly appeared mid-air.</p><p>BOOM—!!</p><p>They blocked the Elder’s spear head-on. Though they looked worse for wear, I immediately recognized them.</p><p>A white-haired old man wielding a sword—there was only one person like that in the academy.</p><p>“…Are you alright?”</p><p>“H-Headmaster?”</p><p>“You’re not an ordinary examiner, are you?”</p><p>Ma Hakjun chuckled, brushing aside the Elder’s spear.</p><p>“…Ma Hakjun.”</p><p>“It’s been a while, Hyuk.”</p><p>“How did you escape?”</p><p>“Did you really think some brats could hold me back for long?”</p><p>It seemed they had stationed people to restrain him, but Ma Hakjun bore the marks of battle. To break through and get here—this was indeed the Ma Hakjun I knew.</p><p>“…Shame I couldn’t kill you earlier. But this works out well.”</p><p>“Is that so? But too bad for you. Even you can’t kill this old man in three minutes.”</p><p>“….”</p><p>“You must’ve realized by now. Reinforcements have arrived. And among them… ‘that person’ is here. In three minutes, they’ll be standing before you. What will you do?”</p><p>At the mention of that person, the Elder, Hyuk, narrowed his eyes. After a brief pause, he glanced in the direction Kim Suhyeon had fled.</p><p>“…How unfortunate. And…”</p><p>The Elder suddenly turned his gaze toward me.</p><p>“You. I’ll remember you.”</p><p>Whether it was admiration or a promise to kill me later, it didn’t seem like a good thing.</p><p>And with that, the Elder vanished without a trace.</p><p>…He’s gone. He’s really gone.</p><p>Unlike the original story, the villains failed to kidnap Kim Suhyeon. Their plan to brainwash her into the Crimson Witch had failed. Even if this wasn’t the end, I had overcome a major hurdle.</p><p>“…Hah.”</p><p>My body collapsed backward. As the tension left me, my vision went white. I think Ma Hakjun was saying something, but I couldn’t hear a word.</p><p>I just… want to sleep for a bit. I’m way past overtime today… so this should be fine, right?</p><p>◎ Blocked Count:</p><p>10 / 10</p><p>◎ Required Threshold Reached:</p><p>Trait is being enhanced.</p><p>…</p><p>&quot;Headmaster.&quot;</p><p>Ma Hakjun turned his head while receiving treatment.</p><p>&quot;You’re here, Professor Han.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh, seriously. Can’t you just call me by my name?&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon, covered in minor wounds, sat down beside him.</p><p>&quot;What’s the damage?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thirty-two dead. One hundred seventeen injured. The victims include students, faculty, and security personnel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Damn it.&quot;</p><p>Han Jiyoon clenched her fists, cursing under her breath. Thirty-two lives were lost. Precious, irreplaceable lives had been taken.</p><p>&quot;Well, at least... it could’ve been worse, right?&quot;</p><p>The healer tending to Ma Hakjun cautiously spoke up. Han Jiyoon was about to lash out, but Ma Hakjun raised a hand to stop her.</p><p>&quot;Forgive me if I spoke out of turn, but even the higher-ups and the Association share this view. Considering two Elders attacked and yet the death toll is only in the double digits... it could have been far worse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Worse? One death alone is a tragedy. Don’t spout nonsense like that.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Han Jiyoon understood. If the Elders had been intent on pure slaughter, she might have been the only survivor. Even Ma Hakjun wouldn’t have held out. He was a hero of the past, but the Elders were living nightmares.</p><p>Yet, one Elder merely stalled for time, while the other focused on something else. The villains they brought along were mediocre at best—clearly only meant to buy time.</p><p>&quot;Hyuk... no, the &#39;Spear Phantom&#39; was after Kim Suhyeon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Survivors reported he was searching for Kim Suhyeon. And Hyun Sujin—that wretched woman—was obviously stalling.&quot;</p><p>Kang Minseong&#39;s granddaughter. A prestigious bloodline, yet lacking exceptional talent. That was the simplest way to describe Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>Ma Hakjun stroked his chin, deep in thought.</p><p>‘Why would they try to kidnap Suhyeon?’</p><p>Was it to threaten or manipulate Kang Minseong? It wasn’t impossible. Kang Minseong&#39;s love for his family was well-known.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon was the only remaining blood relative of Kang Minseong’s late daughter. His affection for her likely surpassed that for his other grandchildren.</p><p>&quot;Careful now, on three. One, two, three.&quot;</p><p>The medics carefully lifted a man onto a stretcher. He wasn’t a student, nor a professor, nor a security officer.</p><p>It was Baek Seojin, the examiner dispatched to the academy today.</p><p>&quot;...Jiyoon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That examiner, Baek Seojin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard. He took that water phantom&#39;s spear twice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Yet he survived. And he never backed down.&quot;</p><p>Even seasoned professors with vast combat experience couldn’t endure that. Ma Hakjun doubted he could withstand two strikes from that spear barehanded.</p><p>But Baek Seojin managed to stall an Elder. Without him, the situation could have been catastrophic. Even in the end, he never showed signs of retreat.</p><p>‘Baek Seojin… Baek Seojin.’</p><p>Both Ma Hakjun and Han Jiyoon watched as Baek Seojin was carried off to the hospital, lost in thought.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 9</h1><p>Sssss—</p><p>A man with a ghostly appearance emerged from the darkness. Seeing him, Hyun Sujin immediately stood up and approached.</p><p>Crunch—!</p><p>Black shadows writhed and grabbed the man by the collar.</p><p>&quot;Hey, Kwak Hyuk. What the hell are you doing right now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;….&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you kidding me? I was holding off Han Jiyoon, and our guys were keeping Ma Hakjun occupied. Your job was simple—just grab one damn kid and get out. Got it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;….&quot;</p><p>&quot;And yet, you failed. Seriously, do you think this is a joke? Huh?&quot;</p><p>Hyun Sujin&#39;s anger was more than justified.</p><p>Two Elders had mobilized just to kidnap a single Academy student. She personally took on the greatest threat, S-rank superhuman Han Jiyoon. Meanwhile, their team had successfully pinned down the troublesome Ma Hakjun.</p><p>With all obstacles out of the way, failure should have been impossible. There was no one strong enough to stop Kwak Hyuk. Even if there was, he could have bulldozed through them. Failure shouldn&#39;t have been an option at all.</p><p>Crack—!</p><p>More black shadows surged, growing denser, as if they would engulf the man at any moment.</p><p>&quot;…Hyun Sujin.&quot;</p><p>Yet, Kwak Hyuk neither gasped nor flinched in pain. He merely spoke her name in a calm, unaffected voice.</p><p>&quot;I had my reasons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Ha!&quot;</p><p>It was ridiculous. So ridiculous that she wanted to kill him on the spot. But he was an Elder, like herself. Fighting within their ranks was something to avoid.</p><p>Besides, if they truly fought, not even Hyun Sujin could guarantee victory. Their abilities were similar in level, and their compatibility favored him in combat.</p><p>&quot;Alright. Let’s hear what kind of excuse the infamous &#39;Spear Phantom&#39; has.&quot;</p><p>The black shadows quickly retreated behind Hyun Sujin. Kwak Hyuk scratched his throat before speaking slowly.</p><p>&quot;A man stood in my way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, someone got in your way. A professor? Or maybe a security officer! Huuuh... Are you talking about that old man Ma Hakjun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Not him. Someone else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then who?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He called himself an examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;An examiner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what? He got in your way. Then, so what?&quot;</p><p>Hyun Sujin&#39;s frustration was reaching its peak. This mission was too important.</p><p>&quot;He survived my spear. Twice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…What?&quot;</p><p>For a moment, she thought she had misheard him. The words coming out of his mouth were too shocking.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying it&#39;s ridiculous. An examiner? Those government officers sent to the Academy? They&#39;re barely on par with the instructors there. And you&#39;re telling me one of those idiots survived your spear—twice?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m just stating facts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Be honest. Did you really go all out? Or were you just messing around?&quot;</p><p>At her mocking tone, a strange glint flickered in Kwak Hyuk&#39;s eyes. That single change in his gaze was enough to shift the entire atmosphere.</p><p>&quot;I have never once held back when wielding my spear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Fine. That was out of line. My bad.&quot;</p><p>Everyone had a line that shouldn’t be crossed. Since she knew her own, she could imagine how it felt to have his crossed. Raising both hands, Hyun Sujin offered an apology.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go over this again. I took care of Han Jiyoon. Our guys handled Ma Hakjun. You went to secure the target.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Correct.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then this examiner blocked your way. You swung your spear like usual, sent him flying, and assumed he was dead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But then he got back up. And after you knocked him away again, he got up a second time?&quot;</p><p>Kwak Hyuk nodded without hesitation.</p><p>&quot;…Ha!&quot;</p><p>Even thinking about it again, it sounded like utter nonsense. Yet coming from Kwak Hyuk, it wasn’t a lie.</p><p>There was no exaggeration or understatement. He only reported things exactly as they were. Hyun Sujin knew this about him, and it made her head throb.</p><p>‘This doesn’t make sense. Maybe if he’d just been stabbed, but to get hit by Kwak Hyuk’s spear shaft and survive? A normal superhuman&#39;s body should have been torn apart instantly. And yet, some examiner with no real combat experience survived not once, but twice?’</p><p>There was only one type of person who could withstand an Elder&#39;s direct attack.</p><p>‘An S-rank…’</p><p>Hyun Sujin&#39;s thoughts were racing.</p><p>He called himself an examiner.</p><p>His rank and affiliation didn’t matter as much as the fact that he was a government employee.</p><p>‘No way… Did they actually go through with that experiment? Did they succeed and plant him as an examiner inside the Academy?’</p><p>It was no secret that villains had their eyes on the Academy. The only reason they hadn’t attacked in full force before was the Academy&#39;s powerful defenses and the villains’ own lack of cooperation. But the government might have prepared for such a scenario.</p><p>‘Those bastards… They actually carried out that cursed experiment!’</p><p>Clenching her teeth, a dark aura oozed from Hyun Sujin’s body. It was enough to make anyone watching shiver in fear. It was the usual reaction whenever someone touched on her sore spot.</p><p>&quot;So what now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;…What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are we going after the Academy again? Or changing tactics for securing the target?&quot;</p><p>At his question, Hyun Sujin flashed a bright smile and responded.</p><p>&quot;Are you insane? Have you lost your mind?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard &#39;that person&#39; arrived at the Academy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;….&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you handle her? That crazy blonde?&quot;</p><p>As soon as news of the Academy attack broke, the highest level of firepower was deployed.</p><p>Among South Korea&#39;s S-rank superhumans, she was undoubtedly the strongest. Even on a global scale, she ranked among the top-tier US-ranks. Even Elders found facing her head-on an unappealing prospect.</p><p>&quot;Damn it. Why couldn’t her parents just stay in their own country instead of immigrating here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She considers herself Korean.&quot;</p><p>&quot;With that blonde hair and blue eyes? Yeah, right.&quot;</p><p>Irritated, Hyun Sujin scratched her head and bit her lip.</p><p>‘I need to investigate that examiner first. If, by any chance, he really did survive that experiment…’</p><p>There were only two possible outcomes—recruit him or eliminate him. Between the two, Hyun Sujin secretly hoped for the first option.</p><p>*</p><p>&quot;Fortunately, there are no major injuries. No damage to bones or internal organs either. It&#39;s quite surprising how stable the patient&#39;s condition is. Hmm… I think you can be discharged in about three days.&quot;</p><p>Doctor, what do you mean? Discharge? Already? Why are you doing this to me? This isn’t fair! I got hit by an Elder!</p><p>I was hoping to stay in bed for about a month. I could get it classified as an on-duty injury. After all, I did fight back against the villains who invaded. It would make for a good story. A perfect opportunity to enjoy some legitimate paid sick leave…</p><p>&quot;I heard you’re getting discharged. Since your body&#39;s in perfect condition, your assignment at the Academy as an examiner is still in place. Don’t complain to me. It’s an order from above, so just follow it quietly.&quot;</p><p>That’s what my old-fashioned boss said when he came to visit. I couldn’t tell if he came out of concern or just to stress me out.</p><p>Thanks to him, I was now worrying about going back to work just three days after being hospitalized.</p><p>‘But still… their reaction isn’t quite what I expected.’</p><p>I thought they’d at least ask about my survival. I had prepared a whole explanation in case they questioned my identity. But no one brought it up.</p><p>‘There are two possibilities. Either they&#39;re deliberately hiding information, or…’</p><p>Or they just assumed the Elder toyed with me like an insect and left.</p><p>Honestly, I figured most people would believe the latter. If I had heard about this, I’d probably think the Elder didn’t take me seriously either.</p><p>At least they seemed to acknowledge my efforts. The hospital room was a private one. I was worried about the bill, but they told me the Academy would cover everything. That was a relief. Now I could enjoy this spacious, comfortable room to my heart’s content.</p><p>&quot;Let’s check the news.&quot;</p><p>I found the remote and turned on the TV.</p><p>As expected, every channel was reporting on the Academy attack.</p><p>[This tragedy resulted in numerous casualties….]</p><p>[The Ability Association announced they will use this incident as an opportunity to….]</p><p>[Academy President Ma Hakjun and Professor Han Jiyoon will be holding a press conference….]</p><p>Han Jiyoon and Ma Hakjun appeared on the screen, looking incredibly busy. I was a little disappointed they hadn’t visited me, but seeing them now, it was understandable. They were probably too swamped with reporters to think of anything else.</p><p>[Meanwhile, a joint funeral is being held for those who lost their lives protecting the students….]</p><p>Seeing the news made it all feel real.</p><p>At the time, I felt like I had no choice but to step up. But now that I think about it, what I did was pure insanity. It&#39;s a miracle I&#39;m still alive.</p><p>‘Let’s think positively. I saved Kim Suhyeon, and I prevented a tragedy where over 500,000 people could have died.’</p><p>I didn’t do it for recognition or attention. I just did what a person should do. I only acted in a way that wouldn&#39;t make me ashamed of myself. That’s all.</p><p>…Still, I was hoping someone would tell me to rest a little longer. Three days is way too soon to return to work.</p><p>Knock, knock—</p><p>“U-uhm… Examiner Baek Seojin?”</p><p>A woman’s voice called out hesitantly from outside the door.</p><p>“This is Kim Suhyeon! I came to visit! Can I come in?”</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 10</h1><p>Creak—</p><p>The hospital room door opened slightly, and a girl with black hair peeked inside.</p><p>“Uhm… Examiner Baek Seojin?”</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>“A-ah, hello! May I come in?”</p><p>“You’ve already opened the door, haven’t you? Come on in.”</p><p>Only then did Kim Suhyeon carefully step inside the hospital room. She looked… well, like a nervous little kitten.</p><p>It wasn’t an act to show off her cuteness. I knew she was just naturally timid. After all, wasn’t her special trait &quot;A genius consumed by inferiority”?</p><p>‘How could someone like her become the Crimson Witch?’</p><p>A girl this shy… destined to become a villain who would be responsible for the deaths of 500,000 people? Just what kind of horrific process would the villains have to put her through to break her mind?</p><p>Villains are villains for a reason. The world has always been that way.</p><p>“Uhm… Are you alright?”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon approached hesitantly, concern written all over her face. She seemed to feel guilty, as if my injuries were somehow her fault.</p><p>But she had no reason to feel sorry. I made my own decision to act. The fastest way to ease her guilt was simple— Show her I was perfectly fine and blur out the worries she carried.</p><p>“As you can see, I’m perfectly fine. I guess I was lucky.”</p><p>“Th-that’s a relief… I was really worried. I wanted to come visit you right away, but everyone stopped me… I’m really sorry. I&#39;m so sorry, Examiner. You risked your life to save me, and I….”</p><p>“It’s really okay. Even if you had come right after, I was unconscious, so we wouldn’t have been able to talk like this.”</p><p>Besides, it was dangerous for Kim Suhyeon to be wandering around during a time like this. The ones who failed could still be lurking, waiting for another chance to strike. If they succeeded, all my efforts to prevent her from becoming the Crimson Witch would be in vain.</p><p>“Still… I’m really sorry. Truly, I am.”</p><p>“I told you it’s fine. Oh, how’s your injury? Last I saw, you had a pretty bad wound on your leg.”</p><p>“Oh? Ah… I-it’s fine now. I received treatment right away, so it’s all healed.”</p><p>Well, if it hadn’t healed, she wouldn’t be here visiting me.</p><p>“By the way, Examiner, you can speak casually with me.”</p><p>“Me? No, no, I’m fine with this.”</p><p>I once got a formal complaint for being too friendly with a student. A parent complained that government employees shouldn’t talk down to children and should always use formal speech.</p><p>It was ridiculous, but I had no choice but to comply. Since then, I just made it a habit to use polite speech with everyone.</p><p>It’s a habit born out of a sad experience, but now it feels wrong to break it. Not following the rules feels like committing a major crime. Getting complaints from the public is an incredible source of stress.</p><p>“But… you’re older than me.”</p><p>“Well, Suhyeon, isn’t it a bit rude to bring up age?”</p><p>“Oh! A-ah! I’m so sorry!!”</p><p>I was just joking, but her overly serious reaction made me feel guilty. As I was about to tell her not to worry, a coughing sound interrupted us from behind.</p><p>Ahem! Ahem!</p><p>I didn’t sense anyone approaching. Kim Suhyeon had entered the room alone— Could it be those damn villains had followed her here?</p><p>“Grandfather.”</p><p>At that moment, Suhyeon stepped toward the old man. Wait… Grandfather? Did she just say grandfather? Now that I looked closely, they did resemble each other a little.</p><p>Hold on a second. That face, that outfit.</p><p>I’d seen him on the news before—on a program called “Heroes of the Past.” He was alongside Ma Hakjun…</p><p>“You must be Baek Seojin. I heard you saved my granddaughter. I came to personally thank you.”</p><p>-Activating The Third Eye.</p><p>◎ Kang Minseong</p><p>The Everlasting Sword</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>Even with the passage of time, his aura remains undiminished. When wielding a sword, all abilities are enhanced. Except in one particular scenario, he will never falter.</p><p>…He’s really Kang Minseong? The very man villains feared and called the Sword Demon? One of the heroes who saved South Korea alongside Ma Hakjun… standing right in front of me?</p><p>‘And his granddaughter is… Kim Suhyeon?’</p><p>Now I could fully understand why the villains were targeting her. If they kidnapped someone with connections to such a big figure, they could use her as leverage.</p><p>Kang Minseong’s family was the pinnacle of the Weaponry lineage in South Korea. I’d heard they produced one S-rank and several A-ranks. They also had deep ties with politicians and major corporations, making their influence immense.</p><p>From the villains’ perspective, capturing Kim Suhyeon was the ultimate move.</p><p>“I’m Baek Seojin. It’s an honor to meet you.”</p><p>I quickly stood up from the bed and bowed.</p><p>There are times when a person needs to set aside their pride. This was undoubtedly one of those times.</p><p>Bowing wasn’t embarrassing or degrading in this case. The old man standing before me commanded respect and power. Ma Hakjun was impressive, but Kang Minseong was equally formidable.</p><p>“If you’re honored to meet me, would you do me a favor?”</p><p>I hesitated for a second—should I say I’ll do my best? That seemed too subservient, so I held back.</p><p>As I quietly waited for his words, Kang Minseong cleared his throat and spoke.</p><p>“I’d like you to accept my granddaughter’s request.”</p><p>“…Excuse me?”</p><p>“She’s been asking you to drop the formalities and even apologizing.</p><p>I think it’s enough. Just give in and go along with it.”</p><p>“I-I mean….”</p><p>“She’s asking you to speak casually, young man.”</p><p>Wait a second. Shouldn’t he be saying ‘Don’t speak informally to my precious granddaughter’ instead? Why was he asking me to be more casual with her?</p><p>“Is that such a difficult request?”</p><p>“No, sir! Since Suhyeon is younger, speaking casually should be fine.”</p><p>Call me a coward if you want. This is just basic survival tactics. And when a hero from the past asks for something, you comply!</p><p>“Then… Suhyeon? Is it okay if I call you that?”</p><p>“Yes! I like it, Examiner!”</p><p>She beamed at me, moving closer. I didn’t understand why dropping formalities made her so happy, but if it made her smile, why not?</p><p>In truth, I wanted to stay close to her for another reason. Not just because she was pretty and came from a powerful family.</p><p>‘The villains might target her again.’</p><p>For now, I could say that the immediate threat of kidnapping had passed thanks to my efforts. But the villains could target Kim Suhyeon again at any time. If they succeeded, she would inevitably become the Crimson Witch as originally intended.</p><p>The problem was that I couldn&#39;t explain any of this to anyone. Not even to Suhyeon herself. The reason was simply too absurd. If someone told me, &quot;You&#39;re destined to become a mass murderer in the future!&quot;, I&#39;d tell them to shut up and stop spouting nonsense.</p><p>The only option was to stay close and watch over her, ready to detect any danger. Since she was Kang Minseong’s granddaughter, there would be plenty of people willing to protect her. All I had to do was buy enough time until they arrived.</p><p>‘Just like I did at the Academy.’</p><p>While I reached this conclusion in my head, Kim Suhyeon sat beside me, chattering away.</p><p>She talked about how she had seen me take down Park Junwoo from a distance—</p><p>how cool it had looked, how grateful she was that I had stood in front of the Elder to protect her. And then she asked if I was really just an ordinary examiner… which made me feel a little guilty.</p><p>Actually, I am an ordinary examiner. It’s just that I don’t stay ordinary when it comes to evaluations.</p><p>“Uh, wait a second. Suhyeon. And, uh… Chairman? Would you like to sit down too…?”</p><p>“I’m fine. Go on, have your conversation. Don&#39;t mind me.”</p><p>But it’s hard not to mind you when you&#39;re just standing there silently, staring at us like that. I don&#39;t even know if Suhyeon&#39;s words are going in one ear and out the other anymore.</p><p>While I struggled with my thoughts, Suhyeon seemed genuinely happy. Eventually, I found myself so engrossed in our conversation that I forgot about Kang Minseong&#39;s presence.</p><p>*</p><p>TN: Kang Minseong&#39;s perspective</p><p>&quot;…&quot;</p><p>Kang Minseong stood by the entrance, quietly watching his granddaughter.</p><p>She looked so much like her mother when she smiled. It felt as though his late daughter had come back to life.</p><p>‘I&#39;m sorry, my dear.’</p><p>Having such a prominent grandfather, an exceptional family, and relatives who were all extraordinary… In comparison, Suhyeon, who could only be considered average, must have felt immense pressure.</p><p>‘Even if we only meant to encourage her, it must have weighed heavily on her.’</p><p>As Kang Minseong’s granddaughter and the only remaining legacy of his late daughter, she had to become stronger—no, she must become a remarkable superhuman. The overwhelming pressure crushed her, making her smaller and smaller over time.</p><p>Not everyone can be special, even if they come from a special family. Ordinary people exist so that the extraordinary can shine. But Suhyeon viewed her own normalcy not as a trait, but as a flaw.</p><p>She spoke less and became more withdrawn. Even after entering the Academy, things only got worse. He had even begged his old friend Ma Hakjun to keep an eye on her.</p><p>And then, the villains attacked. An Elder personally tried to kidnap his granddaughter.</p><p>A tragedy that could have been irreversible— but one young man had prevented it. His name was Baek Seojin, an examiner dispatched to the Academy that day.</p><p>‘He stood in front of the Elder to protect Suhyeon.’</p><p>It was such an unbelievable tale that the media hadn’t even covered it. But Ma Hakjun had personally confirmed it to him. Baek Seojin had indeed faced the Elder, saved Suhyeon, and survived.</p><p>‘Because of that, he must be Suhyeon&#39;s hero… and someone she now admires.’</p><p>He had also apparently defeated every student upon his arrival. Perhaps he was an ordinary person who found his own way to stand out. To Suhyeon, there probably wasn&#39;t anyone she wanted to be like more.</p><p>To be honest, he did have some doubts. It had taken a lot of effort to dissuade Suhyeon from rushing to visit him immediately.</p><p>But in the end, Kang Minseong couldn&#39;t say no to his granddaughter.</p><p>“Examiner, you looked so cool when you did that…”</p><p>“No, no. That was just luck….”</p><p>Watching the two of them chat quietly, Kang Minseong eventually left the room.</p><p>Whatever it was, if it made his granddaughter happy, that was enough for him.</p><p>TN: I can’t wait for Suhyeon’s training arc! Will she become the Crimson Witch as foretold, or will she be something else?</p>"

They do it to mask their own insecurities and try to feel superior in some way.</p><p>Fortunately, Suhyeon hadn’t reached that point. Looking back, I couldn&#39;t recall any instances where she belittled others at the Academy. Her problem was that she constantly made self-deprecating comments.</p><p>I once had a friend like her. Their family struggled financially, and nothing ever seemed to go right. Naturally, they were plagued by severe feelings of inferiority for a long time.</p><p>It had taken years for them to overcome it— understanding themselves, acknowledging the strengths of others, and setting goals while believing that someday they could achieve them too.</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>Kang Minseong entered the room and called out to his granddaughter.</p><p>“My throat&#39;s a bit dry. Could you go get me some water? Take your time and go with the others outside.”</p><p>There was already water in the room, so why send her out to buy more? The reason was clear from the way he looked at me. He wanted to have a private conversation with me.</p><p>Suhyeon nodded and left the room, leaving me alone with Kang Minseong.</p><p>&quot;…&quot;</p><p>Standing next to me was a seasoned warrior with a presence somewhat different from Ma Hakjun’s. I couldn’t help but feel a little nervous about what he was going to say.</p><p>“I realize I haven&#39;t thanked you properly yet.”</p><p>Kang Minseong approached and bowed his head.</p><p>The age gap between us was massive, not to mention our social status. Yet he didn’t hesitate to express his gratitude. It seemed that the title of hero wasn’t given just for strength alone.</p><p>“Thank you. Without you, I would have lost my only granddaughter. And if that had happened... I would have lost my mind.”</p><p>He wasn’t speaking as the head of a powerful family, but as a grandfather who deeply loved his granddaughter.</p><p>I had expected him to be a stern, authority-driven man, but standing before me was simply a thankful and worried grandparent.</p><p>“And... I also owe you an apology.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“You&#39;ve heard that you’ll be returning to the Academy as an examiner after your discharge, right?”</p><p>My supervisor had mentioned that just yesterday— that I should go back to the Academy right after being discharged. But how did he know about it?</p><p>“I... may have asked some acquaintances for a favor. To ensure you quietly return to the Academy.”</p><p>“You did, Chairman? Why?”</p><p>“What do you think of Suhyeon? My granddaughter.”</p><p>Why was he suddenly asking about Suhyeon? He’s not asking for my thoughts as a man, right?</p><p>“I... I don’t quite understand what you mean.”</p><p>“You’ve spoken with her for a while, haven’t you? I imagine you’ve formed some impressions by now. After all, you assessed her as part of your duties.”</p><p>Technically, I relied on my special ability for assessments, but I guess you could call it an eye for talent.</p><p>After a brief hesitation, I decided to speak honestly.</p><p>“…Suhyeon, well, she seems to have low self-esteem and…”</p><p>“No need to sugarcoat it. Just say what’s on your mind.”</p><p>“Uh… I mean, she… has a bit of an inferiority complex.”</p><p>“Oh? You already knew?”</p><p>When I asked, Minseong simply nodded with a calm expression.</p><p>“In a family full of exceptional talents, she was the only one who lacked anything special. No one ever blamed her for it,</p><p>but she convinced herself that she wasn’t good enough.”</p><p>“So that’s why Suhyeon…”</p><p>“I hoped that by enrolling her at the Academy, she’d learn to accept her limits and grow among peers of her age.”</p><p>He had hoped that by spending time with other students, she would slowly come to terms with herself and improve. But instead, she became even more withdrawn.</p><p>“But recently, something changed in her—after meeting you.”</p><p>“…Me?”</p><p>“You’re an ordinary silver-ranked examiner. Just like Suhyeon, you’re not special. But despite that, you’ve found your own way to shine. I believe that inspired her.”</p><p>Minseong said that it was Suhyeon who suggested visiting me in the hospital. It was the first time she had taken the initiative to do anything. Her family members were secretly surprised.</p><p>“That’s when I realized— you might be the one who can help my granddaughter. So I arranged for you to remain at the Academy.”</p><p>That explained why things had been so quiet despite my encounter with an Elder. Considering Minseong’s connections in the government, it made sense.</p><p>I was nodding when he suddenly blurted out in a flustered voice:</p><p>“But listen! I never asked them to discharge you so soon! I only asked them to make sure you could stay as an examiner after recovery. That’s all, I swear!”</p><p>“…Pardon?”</p><p>“When Suhyeon said it was too soon to be discharged, I thought she might find out and blame me. Please, if she asks, tell her I had nothing to do with it!”</p><p>His voice was practically pleading. Of course, I wasn’t about to tell her anything different.</p><p>“Whew. Thank you. You don’t know how relieved I am.”</p><p>Seeing him let out a deep sigh of relief, I realized that beyond being a former war hero, he was just a doting grandfather.</p><p>“Anyway, when you return to the Academy,</p><p>please look after my granddaughter.”</p><p>“You might be expecting too much from me. I’m just an examiner, not a professor.”</p><p>“Suhyeon is still bronze-ranked, isn’t she? That means she’ll have to take your tests often.”</p><p>Oh no. Don’t tell me he wants me to go easy on her in assessments...</p><p>Would he? I mean, he’s a war hero and all, but still… Should I ask him outright? No, that might offend him. But what if he is thinking that? Wouldn’t it be better to clear things up?</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>Before I could ask, the door opened,</p><p>and Suhyeon walked in, carrying bottled water.</p><p>I missed my chance to ask.</p><p>“Here, Grandpa. Have some water.”</p><p>“Thank you, my dear.”</p><p>While Kang Minseong pretended to drink, Suhyeon looked at me hesitantly.</p><p>&quot;Why, Suhyeon? Is there something you want to say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um… You&#39;re still not discharged yet, right, Examiner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I still have a few days left. Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then... c-can I visit again tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>She wanted to come back tomorrow? Even though villains might still be lurking around? We&#39;d be seeing each other at the academy soon enough, so was it really necessary...</p><p>&quot;...Sure. If you want to come, feel free. I could use the company anyway.&quot;</p><p>Under Kang Minseong’s subtle yet firm gaze, I found myself accepting her request without much resistance.</p><p>*</p><p>“I want to visit the examiner in the hospital.”</p><p>When Suhyeon voiced her wish, Kang Minseong and those around him were visibly surprised. For someone as timid as her, expressing her own desires was a rare occurrence.</p><p>She felt ashamed facing her family and guilty for making such an unusual request. Was she being selfish by insisting on something so trivial?</p><p>But even so, she wanted to see the person who had saved her life— to properly express her gratitude and apologize for the trouble she had caused.</p><p>&#39;And…&#39;</p><p>She wanted to tell him that she aspired to be someone like him. Even though he was just a regular examiner, to her, he seemed extraordinary.</p><p>The memories were still vivid in her mind. The way he effortlessly took down the arrogant Park Junwoo. The way he dismantled each overconfident student during the assessments. And finally, how he stood his ground against the terrifying Elder to protect her.</p><p>Unlike her grandfather and her family, he wasn’t born special. He was just an ordinary man—a mere silver-rank examiner. Yet within that ordinariness, he had discovered his own way to be special.</p><p>The feelings that overwhelmed her— were they admiration? Or something more profound?</p><p>Whatever they were, Suhyeon found them comforting. For the first time, something warm had settled deep in her heart.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 12</h1><p>Once again, I found myself facing the dreaded return to work. A question crossed my mind—how is the academy running again so soon after the attack? Just a week ago, the place was in ruins, with fires and collapsed buildings everywhere.</p><p>&quot;...Is this even possible? It looked pretty serious last week.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it is the academy. They said they fixed everything right away, except for a few spots.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow... I guess money really can solve everything, huh?&quot;</p><p>I overheard students whispering behind me. It was true—there’s nothing money can&#39;t do. If something can’t be fixed with money, it just means there wasn’t enough of it.</p><p>‘Did they really fix all that in just a week?’</p><p>Even from a distance, the academy looked almost untouched. Most of the damage seemed to be repaired, with only a few unfinished areas remaining. It really drove home the point that nothing is impossible in a capitalist world.</p><p>&quot;Hey... isn&#39;t that the guy up ahead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah! I&#39;ve been saying it since earlier.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since we were on the subway! Were you even listening?!&quot;</p><p>Guys, you do realize I can hear you, right? If you&#39;re planning to talk about me, at least lower your voices a bit. It&#39;s basic etiquette.</p><p>&quot;I heard he failed everyone who applied for the Silver rank promotion.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Weren&#39;t they supposed to be pretty skilled?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly. They might have bad attitudes, but they weren&#39;t weak.&quot;</p><p>Thankfully, they weren’t gossiping in a bad way. If that&#39;s the case, you guys don’t have to lower your voices. Keep talking. I’m listening.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s an amazing old man.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, an amazing old man.&quot;</p><p>...No, actually, stop talking. You just called me an old man.</p><p>I never thought I&#39;d be called an old man at twenty-four. Just call me an examiner instead, that would hurt less. Now I feel guilty for calling soldiers &quot;sir&quot; when I was a kid.</p><p>&quot;Good to see you again, Examiner Baek Seojin.&quot;</p><p>The security guard I met on my first day greeted me once more. Thankfully, it looked like he hadn’t suffered any serious injuries from the attack.</p><p>&quot;I heard you were hospitalized. Are you okay now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, as you can see, I&#39;m perfectly fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That’s a relief. Still, reporting back to work right after being discharged? You’re quite the dedicated worker.&quot;</p><p>All I could do was smile at his words.</p><p>Who would’ve thought that strong-willed old man, Kang Minseong, would pull strings to get me back here? He claims he didn’t push for immediate reinstatement, but…</p><p>‘More importantly, it seems like my part in the attack was completely buried.’</p><p>I had already suspected this from watching the news while in the hospital. Someone had clearly worked behind the scenes to keep the details hidden.</p><p>Sure, there were some eyewitnesses, but most were too preoccupied with their own fights to notice much. Even if they saw me, they’d probably think I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time—an examiner who accidentally got in the way of an Elder and got swatted aside like a fly.</p><p>‘Honestly, it is pretty unbelievable that I survived facing an Elder.’</p><p>The only person who knows the full story is Suhyeon. But given her personality, she’s unlikely to tell anyone.</p><p>Come to think of it, Suhyeon visited me at the hospital every single day until I was discharged. She&#39;d thank me over and over again, apologizing as if it was all her fault. No matter how much I told her it was fine, she insisted on coming back.</p><p>Thinking about it makes me furious all over again. How could the villains turn such a kind person into the &quot;Crimson Witch&quot;? If she had been evil from the start, it wouldn’t bother me this much.</p><p>‘Anyway, it’s probably better that the incident isn’t public knowledge.’</p><p>I didn’t even fight the Elder—I just got beaten to a pulp and somehow survived. It would be embarrassing to be labeled on TV as &quot;The Examiner Who Survived an Elder’s Attack!&quot;</p><p>I took another look around the academy. On the surface, everything looked normal—just like before the attack. A memorial had been set up with flowers placed in front, honoring those who had lost their lives.</p><p>The academy was showing the world that no matter what happens, it won’t be shaken—not by villains, not by anything.</p><p>&quot;Found you! Hey! Excuse me!&quot;</p><p>A voice called out urgently. I turned around to see…</p><p>‘…A foreigner?’</p><p>A blonde woman with striking blue eyes, hair tied back in a neat ponytail.</p><p>There was no mistaking it—she looked every bit the stereotypical foreigner.</p><p>&quot;You’re the examiner, right? I knew it! I can tell just by looking!&quot;</p><p>But her Korean was flawless. No, not just flawless—her fluency went beyond that.</p><p>&quot;Uh… Me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, you! You&#39;re the one my sister mentioned... Ah!&quot;</p><p>She even talked to herself naturally in Korean. This wasn&#39;t just fluency; she was basically a native speaker.</p><p>Before I could process the situation, she grabbed my hand and started pulling me somewhere.</p><p>The whole thing happened so fast, I didn’t even have time to resist.</p><p>Before I knew it, we were in a quiet, secluded area.</p><p>&quot;No one&#39;s around, right? Looks like we&#39;re good. I heard from Jiyoon unni—did you really survive against that water phantom guy? Unni wouldn&#39;t lie, but... seriously?&quot;</p><p>I just stared at the foreign woman in front of me.</p><p>There were too many shocking things to process at once—her perfect Korean, the fact that she called Han Jiyoon unni, and the way she casually dismissed the Elder as &quot;that water phantom guy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excuse me, but... who are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I asked first, so you answer first, handsome oppa!&quot;</p><p>...Fine. She asked first, so I guess I’ll answer. Definitely not because she called me handsome. Nope.</p><p>&quot;Well... I nearly died, but I survived by sheer luck.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lies.&quot;</p><p>She cut me off immediately and leaned in closer, staring me down.</p><p>&quot;That guy&#39;s spear doesn&#39;t let anyone survive. If it hits, you&#39;re done for. There&#39;s no such thing as luck with him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you saying...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re Hiding Something, Aren&#39;t You?&quot;</p><p>Her questioning gaze made me flinch. She was right—I was hiding something. But there was no reason to shrink back. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m a villain&#39;s spy or scheming something malicious.</p><p>I&#39;m just an ordinary government employee. Sure, I have a unique ability now, but that&#39;s all there is to it. There&#39;s no need to feel guilty. If I act suspiciously, it&#39;ll only raise more questions.</p><p>&quot;Am I wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you&#39;re asking another question, that’s not fair. You should answer mine first, Miss Beautiful.&quot;</p><p>I threw her tactic right back at her. The blonde woman grinned, seemingly impressed by my response. She hadn’t expected me to sidestep her question so easily.</p><p>&quot;Alright, you asked who I am, right? But seriously? All the hints are right in front of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hints?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jiyoon unni, the water demon guy, and, of course, a stunning blonde like me!&quot;</p><p>Wow. Calling yourself &quot;stunning&quot; with such confidence? That’s bold. Then again… I couldn&#39;t really argue with that. She was gorgeous.</p><p>&quot;If you still don&#39;t get it, I’ll be disappointed!&quot;</p><p>What exactly am I supposed to figure out here?</p><p>Sure, she’s beautiful. But her behavior... it&#39;s kind of eccentric.</p><p>‘Wait. Eccentric…?’</p><p>Suddenly, a certain someone came to mind.</p><p>A person so infamous for their insanity that even villains avoided them. A name whispered with dread even among the worst of criminals.</p><p>&#39;The Crazy Blonde.&#39;</p><p>- The Third Eye is activated.</p><p>◎ Irina</p><p>The Battlefield Calls Me!</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>A combat specialist capable of excelling in any type of battle. Her abilities are overwhelmingly enhanced in combat. Fatigue accumulates at a slower rate during battle. Injuries do not weaken her. Even in the most extreme situations, she does not falter.</p><p>‘No doubt about it. It’s her. Irina. The Crazy Blonde.’</p><p>Standing before me was none other than an S-rank ability user, on the same level as Han Jiyoon.</p><p>Despite being only twenty-one years old, Irina was ranked among the top five most powerful people in the world. In Korea, she was often mentioned in debates about the strongest ability users.</p><p>The problem, however, was her unique personality. Her energy levels were unpredictable, and she had an extreme obsession with combat. There was a reason villains called her &quot;The Crazy Blonde.&quot;</p><p>Oh, and she wasn&#39;t a half-Korean mix or anything. She was fully Western. But having been born after her parents immigrated to Korea, she was more Korean than most Koreans.</p><p>&quot;...I didn&#39;t expect to meet you like this, Irina.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh, why so stiff? Don&#39;t call me &#39;Irina&#39; with that formal tone. Relax!&quot;</p><p>TN: MC calls Irina with -Nim honorifics which is too formal.</p><p>&quot;Irina-ssi?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still too stiff, but better than &#39;ma&#39;am.&#39; Let’s go with that!&quot;</p><p>She clapped her hands, seemingly satisfied. This girl was unpredictable—just as the rumors said.</p><p>&quot;Anyway, back to my question! You&#39;re hiding something, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah…&quot;</p><p>&quot;And don’t even think about saying &#39;no.&#39; I can tell when people lie.&quot;</p><p>What was the point of asking if she already had an answer in mind? I wanted to argue back, but the sharpness in her gaze made my mouth shut tight.</p><p>It was a different kind of danger compared to the Elder, but it was just as threatening. If I denied it now, I had a feeling things would get a lot more complicated.</p><p>I needed a way out of this. A way even Irina couldn’t argue against… and I found it!</p><p>&quot;Wait a second, Irina-ssi. I realized something—my turn isn’t over yet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I haven&#39;t finished my turn yet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;One question per turn, remember? I didn&#39;t get a proper answer from you earlier. I made an assumption based on your clues. That means it&#39;s still my turn.&quot;</p><p>It was a bit of a stretch, but it was the only way to stall. If I didn&#39;t, I&#39;d have to answer whether I was hiding something.</p><p>Now, it all depended on Irina&#39;s reaction. Would she accept it or call me out?</p><p>If I knew anything about her, she&#39;d probably…</p><p>&quot;Aha! Aha-ha-ha! You&#39;re not just good-looking, but you&#39;re also pretty smart, huh? You must be popular with girls! Or wait—are you not? Don&#39;t tell me... you&#39;re still single?!&quot;</p><p>...Wow. She switched gears fast, attacking me instead. Despite her foreign looks, her personality was one hundred percent Korean.</p><p>&quot;Hmm. But you know… this makes me even more interested.&quot;</p><p>Great. Now I was on the Elder’s radar and Irina’s.</p><p>What a wonderful day.</p><p>As I tried to figure out how to escape this mess, a familiar voice called out from behind.</p><p>&quot;Examiner Baek Seojin?&quot;</p><p>I turned around.</p><p>The person standing there was none other than Kang Minseong&#39;s granddaughter—</p><p>and the one who was almost turned into the ‘Crimson Witch.&#39;</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon? What are you doing here…?&quot;</p><p>It was Kim Suhyeon.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 13</h1><p>TN: Suhyeon&#39;s PoV</p><p>On any other day, my steps toward the academy would have felt heavy. But today was different. No, from today onward, it would always be different.</p><p>Because at the academy, Examiner Baek Seojin would be there.</p><p>Yesterday, when he was discharged, he said he’d be returning to work immediately. The man who risked his life to save someone like me. An ordinary person, yet so different from me—someone truly special.</p><p>The memory of that moment remained vivid in my mind. The sight of Examiner Baek standing before an Elder, telling me to run.</p><p>He wasn’t a professor. He wasn’t a security officer. He was just an examiner—an ordinary public servant, possibly even more &quot;average&quot; than the students here. Yet, in that moment, he leapt in to protect me, who was nothing.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon. Could you take this with you to the academy tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a fatigue recovery potion made from troll’s blood. Give it to Examiner Baek Seojin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ahem. Ahem. It&#39;s nothing special. He just got injured saving you, so he should have it!&quot;</p><p>Even Grandfather seemed concerned about the Examiner. Though I wasn’t sure why he also asked me to deliver an apology along with the gift.</p><p>I arrived at the academy earlier than usual. I had enjoyed seeing Examiner Baek in the hospital, but I was also excited to see him back at work. I wanted to witness him walking into the academy.</p><p>And my instincts were right.</p><p>There he is.</p><p>Even from a distance, I could tell it was him. I almost ran toward him on impulse, but I took a deep breath and steadied myself.</p><p>He knows who I am now. What if my presence is burdensome to him…?</p><p>Visiting him in the hospital made sense because he was injured because of me. But if I continued hovering around him even at the academy, it might become uncomfortable for him.</p><p>I don’t want to inconvenience him because of me.</p><p>I forced myself to slow down. I clutched the gift Grandfather had given me. If I framed it as a discharge gift, it wouldn’t seem like I was bothering him. Yes, this was enough. With this, I could approach him without—</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>Just a moment ago, he had been walking past the front gate. I quickly scanned my surroundings, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Where did he go? He was just here.</p><p>I had come early just to see him. I had prepared myself to greet him. I needed to find him. Did we miss each other? Did he take another route?</p><p>Would it really be okay for me to look for him?</p><p>I hesitated, afraid that I might be bothering him.</p><p>…No.</p><p>This was Examiner Baek Seojin. The man who welcomed me warmly when I visited the hospital. The man who risked his life against an Elder to save me. He wouldn&#39;t be someone who’d push me away.</p><p>Even if I wasn’t anything special, he’d still greet me with warmth.</p><p>The courage Grandfather always talked about—I decided to hold onto it, just this once.</p><p>Even though I was nervous, even though I was worried, I mustered my resolve and followed his trail. Faint as it was, I could sense the direction he had gone.</p><p>&quot;Examiner Baek Seojin?&quot;</p><p>I wasn’t sure how much time had passed.</p><p>But finally, in a secluded corner of the academy, I found him.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon? What are you doing here…?&quot;</p><p>However, standing next to him was a blonde woman I had never seen before.</p><p>*</p><p>TN: Baek Seojin&#39;s PoV</p><p>I hadn’t expected Kim Suhyeon to show up here. The area was practically deserted, and I hadn’t felt anyone tailing me. Yet, here she was.</p><p>&quot;Ah, um….&quot;</p><p>Her eyes darted around nervously, and she fidgeted awkwardly. She looked like she had just realized she was intruding.</p><p>Then, in a panic, she turned to leave.</p><p>It was exactly what I feared.</p><p>Her low self-esteem was acting up again. If I let her walk away, she would only misunderstand the situation and sink deeper into self-doubt.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon!&quot;</p><p>Just in time, I managed to grab her before she could leave.</p><p>&quot;E-Examiner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good timing, Suhyeon. Actually, I got lost again. You remember last time, right? When I almost wandered into the training hall? I ended up in the wrong place again and was just asking for directions. But then….&quot;</p><p>I turned to Irina, giving her a desperate look.</p><p>Honestly, I didn’t expect much. But she was an S-rank ability user—surely she’d have enough awareness to help me out here.</p><p>&quot;Oh! You here! Another person! You help! Right way!&quot;</p><p>And of course, being Irina, she instantly switched to improvisational acting.</p><p>She sounded like a stereotypical foreigner struggling with Korean. In reality? Her Korean was better than most native speakers’. Scratch that—despite being a foreigner by birth, she was more Korean than most Koreans.</p><p>&quot;I go! We see! Next time!&quot;</p><p>With those words, she turned away as if nothing had happened. But after a few steps, she stopped and glanced back at me.</p><p>&quot;I still want… your answer.&quot;</p><p>Her eyes made it clear.</p><p>She was willing to let me go for now, but there wouldn’t be a second chance.</p><p>And then, she disappeared.</p><p>&quot;Who was that?&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s voice was uneasy as she spoke.</p><p>Her confusion was understandable.</p><p>Irina looked completely different from her usual media appearances. On TV, she always had long, flowing hair and wore her formal uniform. But today, she had tied her hair up, worn casual clothes, and even put on glasses.</p><p>&quot;Well… uh… I think she’s a foreign visitor on an exchange program?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A foreign visitor?&quot;</p><p>It seemed like a reasonable excuse. After all, the academy did get international visitors often.</p><p>But Suhyeon still looked doubtful.</p><p>&quot;You were… asking a visitor for directions?&quot;</p><p>…Good point. That did sound pretty dumb.</p><p>&quot;Ah…! Oh! What’s that in your hands?&quot;</p><p>Desperate, I changed the subject. And thankfully, it worked.</p><p>&quot;This? Oh, it’s… your discharge gift.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A fatigue recovery potion? Wait. Is this made from troll blood?&quot;</p><p>Troll blood was a highly sought-after ingredient due to its potent regenerative properties. It was a staple in most high-grade healing potions.</p><p>A fatigue recovery potion made from troll blood? That meant it was not only highly effective but also very expensive.</p><p>I never expected to receive something so valuable. Then again, this was Kang Minseong we were talking about.</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Grandfather asked me to give it to you personally.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chairman Kang Minseong did? He really sent this for me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;And he also wanted me to apologize on his behalf… Did something happen?&quot;</p><p>Well, something did happen. Your dear grandfather confessed to being the reason I was forced to return to work the day after being discharged.</p><p>It suddenly made sense why he sent such an expensive gift.</p><p>&quot;He wants to make sure I keep my mouth shut, huh.&quot;</p><p>This just confirmed how terrified Kang Minseong was of Suhyeon finding out the truth.</p><p>Even on the day of my discharge, someone from his side had already approached me. They had discreetly slipped me an envelope, saying it was a personal token from the Chairman.</p><p>And when I opened it later? Let’s just say the amount inside made my jaw hit the floor.</p><p>And now, on top of that, he was sending me this? It was clear—he was desperate to keep this under wraps.</p><p>If I were a scumbag, I’d probably be thinking, &quot;How much more can I squeeze out of this?&quot;</p><p>But I wasn’t a villain. I wasn’t some reckless fool either.</p><p>And in this case, the best decision was to keep my mouth shut until the day I died.</p><p>&quot;Nothing special,&quot; I finally said. &quot;The Chairman was just really grateful that I saved you, Suhyeon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Is that so?&quot;</p><p>I had expected her to be happy. Or maybe embarrassed.</p><p>I figured she’d either smile bashfully or grumble about how her doting grandfather was overreacting again.</p><p>But instead, she looked conflicted.</p><p>Instead, she looked… guilty.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon? What’s wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;…I feel so sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For what?&quot;</p><p>“I’m nothing compared to my cousin and younger sibling… just a complete failure. And yet, Grandfather always worries about me. He keeps looking after me, but… the more he does, the more pathetic I feel.”</p><p>There she goes again.</p><p>Every thought, every word, every action—</p><p>all of it was aimed at tearing herself down.</p><p>Just like Kang Minseong had said.</p><p>She’d spent so much time around exceptional people that instead of growing, she had shrunk—locking herself up in a cage of her own making.</p><p>And honestly… it was worse than I expected.</p><p>‘If she’s this bad now… what happens later?’</p><p>Suddenly, I recalled what my Third Eye had shown me about Suhyeon.</p><p>-  Activating the Third Eye</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>A Genius consumed by Inferiority</p><p>◎ Detailed Information:</p><p>All abilities are temporarily reduced. Prolonged inferiority could result in permanent power loss. Improper development could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p>That was understandable. Her mental state was clearly unstable.</p><p>But the last part was what bothered me the most.</p><p>&quot;If she fails to overcome her inferiority complex, she may permanently lose her abilities.&quot;</p><p>That was a major problem.</p><p>Even now, she was barely holding on at the academy.</p><p>If she lost her abilities, she&#39;d be expelled—</p><p>and if that happened, she’d completely drown in her inferiority complex.</p><p>And once that happened…</p><p>This wasn’t just about one person’s self-esteem issues anymore.</p><p>Over 500,000 lives depended on this.</p><p>All the pain I had endured — getting beaten half to death by an Elder — everything I had done to change the future was at stake.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon had to grow.</p><p>She needed to succeed at the academy,</p><p>develop into a strong superhumans,</p><p>and most importantly — escape from the crushing weight of her inferiority.</p><p>Only then… would the Crimson Witch never come to be.</p><p>If this world really had something like a &quot;game system,&quot; I was pretty sure a big red warning screen would be flashing right now:</p><p>[ALERT: Prevent Kim Suhyeon from becoming the Crimson Witch!]</p>"

Damn... her figure is insane.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, keep your voice down. Don&#39;t be so loud.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She probably doesn’t understand us anyway, so who cares?&quot;</p><p>Hearing the murmurs of the academy students, Irina chuckled.</p><p>‘Doesn’t understand? Pffft. I understand way too well—that’s the problem.’</p><p>&#39;Insane figure? Ahaha! I am pretty sexy, aren’t I?&#39;</p><p>She skipped through the academy halls, brimming with excitement. Her disguise was working even better than expected.</p><p>In movies, people would change their hair a little, throw on some glasses, and—bam!—perfect disguise.</p><p>That’s so unrealistic!</p><p>TN: Clark Kent moment.</p><p>Or so she thought.</p><p>But now, having pulled off the exact same trick, she had to admit—Damn. It actually works.</p><p>She could openly stroll through the academy without a single student recognizing her.</p><p>&#39;Will the damn villains fall for this? Should I head to a crime-ridden area like this? Someone might try to mess with me. Then I can legally beat them to a pulp.&#39;</p><p>Villains had no restrictions when it came to attacking superhuman. But superhumans were generally required to capture villains rather than kill them.</p><p>Even those scumbags had &quot;basic human rights.&quot; Or so the damn human rights committees kept saying.</p><p>If a superhumans killed a villain without proper cause, the press and the authorities would throw a fit.</p><p>Even the Superhumans Association would start preaching about restraint.</p><p>&#39;Go ahead and throw your tantrums. Human rights? For villains? This country is really messed up!&#39;</p><p>That said, there was one exception.</p><p>If a villain posed a serious, immediate threat to an Superhuman, lethal force was allowed.</p><p>&#39;Maybe I should go blow off some steam.&#39;</p><p>She did have the perfect excuse: revenge for the academy attack.</p><p>Even the other S-rank Superhumans wouldn’t have much to say about it.</p><p>Irina considered it for a moment.</p><p>Then, she shook her head.</p><p>Was it because she cared about her reputation? Afraid to tarnish her title as the strongest Superhumans in Korea?</p><p>Pffft. Hell no.</p><p>&#39;If my mom finds out, she&#39;ll literally kill me!&#39;</p><p>Visibly shuddering, she quickly shoved the thought away.</p><p>She glanced around to make sure no one was watching, then removed her glasses.</p><p>With a swift shake of her head, her golden hair cascaded down like a waterfall of light.</p><p>&quot;Hup!&quot;</p><p>With a single step, she launched herself off the ground.</p><p>BOOM—!</p><p>In an instant, a golden meteor shot into the sky.</p><p>&#39;Crap. Jiyoon is gonna yell at me again.&#39;</p><p>Didn’t Jiyoon say not to pull this kind of stunt inside the academy?</p><p>The sensation at her toes confirmed it—she’d definitely shattered the ground with that takeoff.</p><p>...Whatever. She&#39;d just forget about it.</p><p>Landing smoothly on a nearby rooftop, Irina hummed a tune as she sat down, gazing at the city below.</p><p>Life had been so boring lately.</p><p>But today?</p><p>Today was turning out to be incredibly interesting.</p><p>‘Baek Seojin.’</p><p>She recalled the silver-rank examiner she had met earlier.</p><p>Tall. Handsome. Seemed pretty decent as a person.</p><p>But what really piqued her interest was—</p><p>‘That incident.’</p><p>‘He took a direct hit from the Water Phantom’s spear and survived. Now that has my attention.’</p><p>A deep grin spread across her face.</p><p>She replayed her conversation with Jiyoon in her mind.</p><p>*</p><p>A Few Hours Ago…</p><p>&quot;Unnie. You still haven’t found the Water Phantom?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope. Don’t get your hopes up. He’s too good at hiding. And with Hyun Sujin covering him, tracking him is basically impossible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ha! That coward. He ran away because he knew I was coming, right?&quot;</p><p>Even among Elders, Kwak Hyuk was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Even Jiyoon avoided making careless remarks about him.</p><p>After all, predicting the outcome of a fight with him was nearly impossible.</p><p>But Irina?</p><p>She earned the right to talk like this.</p><p>She was the only person to ever defeat him.</p><p>Of all the Elders, there was one opponent he feared—</p><p>And that was Irina.</p><p>‘That bastard only turned traitor because he lost to her.’</p><p>Years ago, Kwak Hyuk had been an S-rank Superhumans.</p><p>Arrogant. Overconfident. Insufferably full of himself.</p><p>But his skill was undeniable—no one could challenge him.</p><p>Until—</p><p>He lost.</p><p>To a teenage girl.</p><p>An S-rank Superhuman, completely crushed by a high schooler who hadn’t even entered the academy yet.</p><p>The humiliation shattered him.</p><p>He spiraled into madness, abandoned his rank, and became a villain—</p><p>All because he wanted one thing.</p><p>To defeat Irina.</p><p>To sharpen his spear, to prove he was stronger.</p><p>‘His arrogance turned into a lethal poison.’</p><p>Jiyoon sighed, shaking her head as she looked at Irina.</p><p>&quot;That idiot keeps saying he wants a rematch, but he just keeps running away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He needs to actually fight if he wants to win. How else is he gonna learn?&quot;</p><p>Every time she saw Irina, she questioned reality.</p><p>How was this woman considered one of the strongest in the world?</p><p>&quot;Anyway, aren’t you heading back yet?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should. But first—tell me about that examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…What examiner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on, Unnie. I heard everything.&quot;</p><p>Jiyoon sighed again.</p><p>She knew Irina would never let this go.</p><p>She’d hunt down Baek Seojin no matter what.</p><p>&quot;Baek Seojin. Silver-rank examiner. Superhuman after the incident, but had no notable abilities. Failed to get into the academy. Passed the civil servant exam and became a rank-9 administrative officer. That’s it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…That’s it? Seriously?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That’s it.&quot;</p><p>Irina wasn’t buying it.</p><p>There had to be something more.</p><p>Maybe a secret family background? A hidden ability?</p><p>&quot;Nope. He’s listed as having no family. Probably lost them during a Gate incident. So don’t mention that. It’s a sensitive topic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I get it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I honestly can&#39;t wrap my head around this. A failed superhuman who couldn&#39;t even get into the Academy, yet he survived an Elder&#39;s attack. Twice. And on top of that… he still stood in their way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ooooh! What if it’s that?&quot; Irina clapped her hands together, her eyes sparkling. &quot;You know—&#39;Himsoomjin!&#39;&quot;</p><p>&quot;…What the hell is that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ehh? Unnie, seriously? You don’t know Himsoomjin? Hiding his power, but acting like a loser!&quot;</p><p>Jiyoon frowned, her patience already wearing thin.</p><p>&quot;What kind of nonsense—&quot;</p><p>Before she could finish, Irina struck where it hurt most.</p><p>&quot;Wait… don’t tell me. You really don’t know? Wow. Our dear Unnie is getting so old.&quot;</p><p>“…What did this crazy bitch just say?&quot;</p><p>Jiyoon immediately grabbed her sword from beside her.</p><p>Talking about a woman’s age? In front of her face?</p><p>Irina had officially crossed the line.</p><p>And that was punishable by death.</p><p>&quot;Ahaha! I&#39;m just messing with you! Anyway, fun story! No Drowned Ghost, no target, so I&#39;m out!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You little—!&quot; Jiyoon swung her sheathed sword, eyes blazing. &quot;You&#39;re not leaving until I beat the shit out of you!&quot;</p><p>But Irina, ever the agent of chaos, only grinned wider as she dodged back.</p><p>&quot;Hihi! Sorry! But it’s true, unnie. You are getting old!&quot;</p><p>&quot;IRINA—!!&quot;</p><p>*</p><p>Irina lazily glanced at her phone and tapped the call button.</p><p>&quot;Yeah? When are you coming out? Huh? Me? I&#39;m not at the Academy. I&#39;m... uh, on a building. Dunno. Just picked the tallest one I saw. So where am I, you ask? Figure it out yourself.&quot;</p><p>She smirked, twirling a lock of golden hair around her finger.</p><p>&quot;Aide or not, you should at least have that much competence. Huh? Not my problem. Oh, and if you&#39;re not here in ten minutes, I&#39;m leaving without you.&quot;</p><p>The distressed cry of the aide from the other end was completely ignored.</p><p>Call ended.</p><p>She lowered her phone, her thoughts immediately shifting to Baek Seojin.</p><p>‘Two possibilities. He’s either hiding it, or… he doesn’t even know. Just like I didn’t, back then.’</p><p>To confirm, she had deliberately grabbed his hand, channeling just enough energy to sense his reaction.</p><p>No matter how much someone concealed their strength, their body would always respond to an external force. It was instinct—a fundamental law among the powerful.</p><p>And Irina’s conclusion?</p><p>‘He has no clue.’</p><p>Not completely sure, but at least 80% confident.</p><p>&quot;Aaah, this is way too exciting,&quot; she purred, stretching her arms over her head.</p><p>That clueless handsome oppa was sitting on something massive, and he didn&#39;t even realize it.</p><p>The moment he truly understood his power—How terrifying would he become?</p><p>Just thinking about it sent a thrill down her spine.</p><p>Forget Kwak Hyuk, that ugly bastard.</p><p>That freak could never give her the heart-racing, pulse-pounding battle of a lifetime.</p><p>But Baek Seojin? Oh, he would.</p><p>And unlike that repulsive excuse of a man, he was actually good-looking too.</p><p>Not only would she enjoy the fight, but she wouldn’t have to endure an eyesore while doing it.</p><p>A win-win situation!</p><p>&quot;Uuuuugh—!&quot;</p><p>Irina stretched again, then suddenly froze, a wild grin breaking across her face.</p><p>&quot;Oh. My. God.&quot;</p><p>She clapped her hands together.</p><p>&quot;Is this what they call…&quot;</p><p>A dramatic pause.</p><p>&quot;KIJAP?!&quot;</p><p>A burst of manic laughter followed.</p><p>&quot;AHHHH! AHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</p><p>The sheer absurdity of it made her cackle like a madwoman.</p><p>If any villains had been nearby, they would have muttered,</p><p>&quot;Yep. Crazy Blonde Bitch. Still living up to her name.&quot;</p>"

If anyone got too close, she tensed up, clenching her fists.</p><p>I still remembered how she acted when she visited me in the hospital—smiling brightly, chatting away happily.</p><p>But that was only in front of me.</p><p>Seeing her like this now, I couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for her.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon.&quot;</p><p>Still glancing around.</p><p>It was like watching a black cat—no, a black meerkat.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Did something happen?&quot;</p><p>Was she still shaken from nearly being abducted by Elder?</p><p>That wasn&#39;t impossible. I&#39;d heard some students were suffering from PTSD after the attack.</p><p>&quot;A-Ah, no. It&#39;s fine, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>That was a lie.</p><p>It was all too obvious.</p><p>The way she fidgeted with her hands, the nervous glint in her eyes—Anyone could see that she was anything but fine.</p><p>&quot;There won’t be any more villain attacks. Security has been tightened after the last incident.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I know. That’s... that’s a relief.&quot;</p><p>She didn&#39;t look relieved at all.</p><p>So it wasn’t Elder she was afraid of. This was something else.</p><p>I followed her gaze, observing where her eyes landed.</p><p>She had no reaction when people were far away. But whenever someone approached, she grew visibly uneasy.</p><p>It was a strange response.</p><p>As if she didn’t want them to come closer.</p><p>Ah.</p><p>I got it.</p><p>The reason why she was acting like this.</p><p>The legendary hero Kang Minseong. The greatest weapons master in history. And his granddaughter.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>I was the only one ignorant of this fact. Everyone else knew.</p><p>Of course, that meant everyone was watching her.</p><p>‘Whether it was for good reasons or bad ones, it didn&#39;t matter.’</p><p>To Kim Suhyeon, all of it had become overwhelming stress and suffocating pressure.</p><p>That bastard Park Junwoo had clearly tried to use her for his own gain.</p><p>She thought she was nothing, yet she was constantly surrounded by people who expected everything.</p><p>And among them were those vile enough to try and exploit her.</p><p>With her already fragile sense of self-worth, all of this must have turned into pure poison.</p><p>She was afraid of people approaching her—of their expectations.</p><p>For someone who believed herself to be worthless, that must have been even more terrifying than a nightmare.</p><p>‘She needs help.’</p><p>Kang Minseong had said that my presence seemed to have influenced her.</p><p>It had only been a brief encounter, but in that moment, I had done something she had desperately wanted to do herself.</p><p>‘What did that friend of mine say again about overcoming this?’</p><p>The first step in overcoming an inferiority complex—Acknowledging your own shortcomings.</p><p>The hardest yet most crucial part.</p><p>I still remembered how my friend had described it.</p><p>&quot;They&#39;re lucky.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The students here. They&#39;re lucky to have made it into the Academy.&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s interest was piqued.</p><p>Good. That was the first step.</p><p>Of course, this meant I had to self-destruct a little, but so what?</p><p>&quot;I failed the entrance exams multiple times.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought just awakening my ability would be enough. That once I had power, everything would work out like it did for everyone else. But it didn’t. My life actually got worse after awakening.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I was treated like trash.&quot;</p><p>People like me—who had abilities but weren’t strong enough to fight—were treated like half-baked rejects by the Superhuman.</p><p>And frauds by non-Superhuman people.</p><p>&quot;It was miserable. It drove me insane. This wasn’t the future I had imagined. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I thought I could be like everyone else. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t.&quot;</p><p>&quot;....&quot;</p><p>&quot;I spent months lost, wandering. Until one day, I found myself on the Han River Bridge.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No!&quot;</p><p>Suhyeon suddenly grabbed my hand in alarm.</p><p>If anyone saw, they’d think I was about to jump off a bridge right here and now.</p><p>&quot;I stood there, thinking—Why the hell am I so miserable? I hadn’t committed a crime. I hadn’t hurt anyone. I was just unlucky. And that pissed me off. And in that moment... things became clear.&quot;</p><p>I stopped walking for a second, glancing around the Academy.</p><p>Then, I looked straight at Suhyeon.</p><p>&quot;Just live. Not trying to be like them, but living as myself. It&#39;s not about being worse than them and feeling miserable about it.</p><p>It&#39;s about accepting it and just working hard in my own way.&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon listened in silence.</p><p>She looked surprised—Surprised that I had a past so similar to hers. That I was honest about something most people would rather keep hidden.</p><p>I didn’t expect her to suddenly change overnight.</p><p>But if I could stir even the smallest ripple in her heart— That alone would be enough.</p><p>&quot;…Examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, Suhyeon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;So… are you okay now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m still a half-rate, fake ability user or whatever they want to call me. But I’m getting by as a government worker. I don’t look at others anymore—I just focus on myself. And in the process, I met Jiyoon, got my ass beat by an Elder… So, yeah, I’d say I’m doing fine. Wouldn’t you agree?&quot;</p><p>Suhyeon looked at me for a moment, then turned back ahead.</p><p>She didn’t nod or smile, but just thinking about it was already an improvement.</p><p>Even the smallest shift in perspective could lead to big changes later.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon. Isn’t your lecture starting soon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah! It’s almost time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You shouldn’t be standing around then. Go on before you’re late.&quot;</p><p>At my instruction, she nodded and took a few steps forward—Then suddenly turned back to face me.</p><p>&quot;…Thank you, Examiner. I’ll see you later.&quot;</p><p>Her posture was just a bit steadier than before.</p><p>Feeling a quiet relief, I nodded in return.</p><p>*</p><p>Academy lectures fall into two main categories:</p><p>Theory and Practical Training.</p><p>Theory was the standard classroom-type class. And as always, students who underestimated it would suffer greatly.</p><p>The definition and concepts of Superhuman abilities. The ethics and responsibilities every Superhuman must uphold. The strengths and weaknesses of each ability type. Emergency response procedures and protocol. Gate classification and handling monsters or villains.</p><p>‘They say the real enemy of graduation is the Theory curriculum, after all.’</p><p>Practical Training, on the other hand, was divided into two types:</p><p>On-campus training. External field missions. Field missions focused on real combat experience, usually inside Gates.</p><p>If luck was bad, students could even end up fighting villains.</p><p>Now, why did I, a non-student, know so much about these lectures?</p><p>Because my job was connected to it.</p><p>Rank evaluations happened outside of lecture times.</p><p>Meaning, when students had free time, they rushed to take their exams.</p><p>‘I just didn’t expect this many…’</p><p>A rough headcount showed over thirty applicants.</p><p>And that was even with other instructors helping out.</p><p>Some of the professors had died or been injured in the recent villain attack.</p><p>That left gaps in the schedule, leading to this surge of evaluation requests.</p><p>‘The other staff saw this coming and tried to help, but…’</p><p>With it still being early in the semester, many students wanted to move up to Silver rank.</p><p>But faculty members were tied up with their own work, so they couldn’t handle the load alone.</p><p>That’s why evaluators from the Measurement Department were sent—And I was one of them.</p><p>Originally, there should’ve been more of us, but thanks to that stupid Challenge system, my colleagues kept dodging this job.</p><p>&quot;Ugh…&quot;</p><p>I sighed and scanned the gathered students.</p><p>Unlike last time, I didn’t see any suspicious-looking punks.</p><p>Most of them genuinely wanted to advance from Bronze to Silver.</p><p>‘Good. If another group of assholes had shown up, I would’ve started cursing.’</p><p>&quot;Examiner.&quot;</p><p>The first student I was evaluating today.</p><p>&quot;Lee Hyunwoo.&quot;</p><p>The protagonist.</p><p>The hard-working genius who would one day surpass talent itself.</p><p>&quot;Are you feeling alright, sir?&quot;</p><p>I smiled and gave him a very sad answer.</p><p>&quot;If I’m here at work, I think that answers your question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…You must be going through a lot.&quot;</p><p>He looked at me with sympathy.</p><p>Even to him, my situation probably seemed ridiculous.</p><p>Being forced to work right after being discharged from the hospital…</p><p>Maybe he was mentally noting to never become a government employee.</p><p>Or maybe that was just my imagination.</p><p>&quot;You were incredible, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>As I was getting ready to start the test, Hyunwoo suddenly said that.</p><p>Incredible?</p><p>What the hell was he talking about?</p><p>I looked at him, puzzled, and he continued—</p><p>&quot;For standing against the Elder.&quot;</p><p>What?</p><p>You saw that too?</p><p>I thought only Suhyeon knew.</p><p>And what’s this “incredible” nonsense?</p><p>I got my ass beat into the ground.</p><p>My ability just wouldn’t let me run away.</p><p>&quot;I admire that courage. I hope to have that kind of strength too.&quot;</p><p>Standing against an Elder isn’t courage.</p><p>It’s just reckless idiocy.</p><p>Even A-rank Superhumans couldn’t withstand them.</p><p>What was this kid talking about?</p><p>Before he could say anything more embarrassing, I quickly changed the subject.</p><p>&quot;Let’s get started. There are a lot of students waiting behind you.&quot;</p><p>Hyunwoo was the protagonist.</p><p>A guaranteed first-place lottery ticket.</p><p>Right now, he was just Bronze-ranked,</p><p>but one day, he would become an unstoppable force.</p><p>That was good news for me.</p><p>I needed him to get there.</p><p>With Gates going out of control, monsters increasing, and villains waiting for their chance…</p><p>Things were only going to get worse.</p><p>And when that time came—I needed Hyunwoo to be strong.</p><p>‘Which is exactly why I can’t let him pass yet.’</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Baek Seojin</p><p>Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>No one can pass without the Gatekeeper’s permission.</p><p>And then—</p><p>A new notification appeared.</p><p>- Required Condition Met</p><p>◎ Trait Enhancement Activated.</p><p>-  New Sub-Traits Unlocked.</p><p>◎ Sub-Trait: Sole Evaluator</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>Anyone who has failed to receive a promotion from you will continue to be considered your examinee.</p><p>◎ Sub-Trait: No Pain, No Gain</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>Every time a selected candidate fails a promotion, a stack is accumulated.</p><p>When they finally pass, their abilities are enhanced in proportion to the accumulated stacks.</p><p>One thing I could say with absolute confidence—I wasn’t blocking Hyunwoo’s promotion out of spite.</p><p>It was for his own good.</p>"

This is all for your own good.’</p><p>Before the evaluation began, I set the target of ‘No Pain, No Gain’ to Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>◎ No Pain, No Gain</p><p>Trait is now active.</p><p>Target: Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>&quot;I’m ready, Examiner!&quot;</p><p>Since my trait was already in play, I unintentionally gave him the first move.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo’s sword came straight at me.</p><p>Far superior to the thugs I had tested a few days ago.</p><p>The old me wouldn’t have even reacted to an attack at this speed.</p><p>But now?</p><p>His movements were crystal clear.</p><p>I could see exactly how he would move and how I should counter.</p><p>Swish—!</p><p>I dodged his sword trajectory and instantly closed the distance.</p><p>Right as his blade was about to swing again—I cut him off.</p><p>No matter how skilled a swordsman was, if their swing was disrupted, their attack lost power.</p><p>Predicting an opponent’s moves was nothing short of fatal.</p><p>&quot;Urgh!&quot;</p><p>The outcome was already decided.</p><p>Hyunwoo wasn’t passing today.</p><p>The only question was how he would lose and what he would take away from it.</p><p>For now, I’d help him unlock his full potential.</p><p>He was too fixated on his sword. It was time to show him the possibility of Dual.</p><p>‘If you ever lose your weapon, what will you do then, Hyunwoo?’</p><p>I relentlessly targeted his sword.</p><p>Not allowing him to swing properly. Not even letting him hold it steady.</p><p>That was the weakness of Weaponry abilities.</p><p>Lose your weapon, and your combat ability plummets.</p><p>For all the advantages they had, there was a corresponding penalty.</p><p>‘Guys like Ma Hakjun and Kang Minseong made up for it with overwhelming swordsmanship—or by becoming Duals.’</p><p>Han Jiyoon was the same. So was Irina.</p><p>And the Elders? They had all made the exact same choice.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo needed to grasp that, and fast.</p><p>Bang—!</p><p>At last, his sword flew from his grip and crashed onto the ground.</p><p>Any other student would have immediately surrendered.</p><p>But not him.</p><p>As expected of the protagonist, his persistence was on another level.</p><p>&quot;Hup—!&quot;</p><p>He took advantage of my forward momentum from the last attack.</p><p>A precise body blow aimed at my right side.</p><p>Sharp, calculated—exactly what I’d expect from someone destined to be a Dual.</p><p>Unfortunately for him—</p><p>Thud!</p><p>My knee struck his chest first.</p><p>‘That was close.’</p><p>Even knowing he was a guaranteed cheat character, this felt excessive.</p><p>Still just a Bronze rank, yet his martial arts were already razor-sharp.</p><p>Maybe he was secretly training at some underground gym?</p><p>&quot;Haa… haa…&quot;</p><p>Hyunwoo lay sprawled on the floor, gasping for air.</p><p>Short as the fight had been, the intense movement had drained him.</p><p>&quot;I… lost, Examiner. I acknowledge my defeat.&quot;</p><p>◎ No Pain, No Gain</p><p>Trait Activated.</p><p>Target’s stack increased by 1.</p><p>&quot;You fought well, Hyunwoo. I hope you’re not too disappointed.&quot;</p><p>He couldn’t be.</p><p>He still had a long way to go before his promotions would stop failing.</p><p>And in the end, every failure only made him stronger.</p><p>As I offered him a hand, he grinned as he took it.</p><p>&quot;Not at all! This just makes me want to work even harder! Next time, I’ll definitely pass!&quot;</p><p>As expected of the Master of Effort, surpassing even talent itself.</p><p>Was it protagonist buffs? Or just his natural personality?</p><p>Either way, I was relieved.</p><p>He wasn’t discouraged. He wasn’t angry.</p><p>That was what mattered most.</p><p>&quot;Alright. Next student, step forward.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes! Hello! I’m a second-year—&quot;</p><p>And so, I continued evaluating the Bronze-ranked students.</p><p>Hoping to find another hidden gem, I watched carefully.</p><p>But most of them were ordinary.</p><p>‘No one else worthy of No Pain, No Gain.’</p><p>I moved on, standing face to face with the next student.</p><p>Of course, I had no intention of letting them pass easily.</p><p>After blocking the promotion of ten students, my trait had strengthened.</p><p>Which meant—if I approved too many promotions, it might weaken my Gatekeeper ability.</p><p>Only those who truly deserved it would advance.</p><p>I felt a little bad for the students desperate for their promotions, but there was no malice in this.</p><p>If anything, I was doing this for them.</p><p>Most Superhumans who died in combat fell at C-rank.</p><p>And in Academy terms, C-rank was the same as Silver.</p><p>If they got even slightly stronger here, they’d have a better shot at survival later.</p><p>Fighting monsters. Battling villains. Their chances of getting hurt—or worse, killed—would drop.</p><p>Which meant—</p><p>‘None of you are getting past me.’</p><p>It was all for their own good. Absolutely.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>&quot;Alright, that’s it for today’s lecture.&quot;</p><p>The professor, arm still in a cast, gathered his books and dismissed the class.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon quickly packed up her notes, moving a little faster than usual.</p><p>Normally, she would hesitate—stealing glances at those around her, stiff with anxiety.</p><p>And truthfully, that nervousness hadn’t vanished completely.</p><p>Even before class, she had heard the whispers.</p><p>&quot;She’s Kang Minseong’s granddaughter, yet she did nothing during the attack.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everyone else fought, but she stood there like a powerless nobody.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is she really related to Kang Dokyung and Kang Jisoo?&quot;</p><p>Clench.</p><p>She bit her lip, trying to push the words away.</p><p>But it wasn’t easy.</p><p>It never was.</p><p>The weight of her grandfather’s legacy. The brilliance of her uncle. The undeniable talent of her cousins.</p><p>Each one suffocated her.</p><p>Even those looking down on her were still ahead of her.</p><p>She was still stuck at Bronze, while they had all reached Silver.</p><p>She was weak.</p><p>Too weak.</p><p>A disgrace of a superhuman.</p><p>Shivering.</p><p>She nearly spiraled into that dark place again—</p><p>But then…</p><p>&quot;I admitted that I wasn’t as good as everyone else.&quot;</p><p>Baek Seojin’s words echoed in her mind.</p><p>How could he say that so easily?</p><p>How could he accept it?</p><p>‘…Examiner, I want to see you.’</p><p>Her feet moved on their own.</p><p>She was headed straight for the examination grounds.</p><p>Some lectures had been canceled. Others postponed to upcoming weeks.</p><p>Which meant students had more free time—and many would be using it for their rank evaluations.</p><p>‘He must be exhausted…’</p><p>Being thrown back into work right after getting discharged from the hospital? It was ridiculous.</p><p>But Baek Seojin had only laughed it off, saying it couldn’t be helped.</p><p>He had his own reasons, so she hadn’t asked further.</p><p>At least Kang Minseong had given him a recovery potion.</p><p>That was some relief.</p><p>Step, step.</p><p>When she arrived, the evaluations were already in progress.</p><p>A student, drenched in sweat, was desperately casting magic.</p><p>And on the opposite end—slowly advancing despite the barrage of spells—stood the Examiner.</p><p>‘Baek Seojin…’</p><p>The outcome was obvious.</p><p>The student’s magic was slow, inaccurate. The casting speed alone was an issue, and the accuracy? Worse.</p><p>Baek Seojin could have ended it at any moment.</p><p>But he didn’t.</p><p>Instead, he let the student keep casting—drawing out the fight, giving them as many chances as possible to improve.</p><p>&quot;Man, the Examiner’s insane. Isn’t he tired? That’s his twelfth match already.&quot;</p><p>At the voice beside her, Kim Suhyeon flinched, turning her head.</p><p>&quot;You here for an evaluation too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;…No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No? Huh. Well, I guess that makes sense. Some students were running off to get tested by the assistants instead. Apparently, it&#39;s way easier to pass that way. But really, what’s the point of getting Silver like that? They’ll just get stuck later. I’d rather get completely wrecked now and actually improve.&quot;</p><p>Suhyeon narrowed her eyes slightly, glancing at his name tag.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>The boy beside her was named Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>&quot;…Did you lose to Examiner Baek Seojin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh. Yeah. It wasn’t even close. He completely put me in my place. That guy’s no joke.&quot;</p><p>At those words, a tiny smile tugged at Suhyeon’s lips.</p><p>She wasn’t the only one who thought highly of Baek Seojin.</p><p>It wasn’t a bad feeling.</p><p>In fact, she felt a little proud.</p><p>&quot;If you’re going to get examined, make sure it’s with him. Ah, wait—are you an upperclassman?&quot;</p><p>Suhyeon shook her head.</p><p>&quot;Oh, good. Wait—don’t tell me. You’re already Silver?&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Bronze.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bronze? Nice. That makes us comrades.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Comrades?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I’m Bronze too.&quot;</p><p>For a while—no, for quite a long time—Silver would remain nothing more than a distant dream for these two Bronzes.</p>"

That would’ve been nice.</p><p>This whole situation was frustrating.</p><p>I had my reasons for doing this, but no one cared.</p><p>If they only knew what was really going on, maybe they’d understand.</p><p>Not that I could quit.</p><p>Because of Kim Suhyeon?

A staff member?</p><p>Or maybe Ma Hakjun was looking for me again?</p><p>I was still considering the possibilities when the door cracked open.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p><p>A female student peeked in hesitantly.</p><p>&quot;Ah, hello, Examiner Baek Seojin. Sorry to disturb you while you’re resting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It’s fine, really. I was just about to head out anyway. But—who are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah! I’m here from the Student Council.&quot;</p><p>Ah.</p><p>The infamous Student Council.</p><p>You couldn’t have an Academy setting without them.</p><p>As expected, this Academy’s Student Council was made up of elites.</p><p>By external standards, that meant they were at least B-rank Awakeners.</p><p>And their backgrounds? Just as impressive.</p><p>Grandsons of corporate chairmen. Daughters of top-ranking clan masters.</p><p>If Kim Suhyeon had been more skilled, she probably would have joined them too.</p><p>That was the level of prestige they held in the Academy.</p><p>There were a few annoying members, of course, but from what I remembered, the President kept them in check.</p><p>‘Wait… Didn’t the President and Treasurer end up joining Lee Hyunwoo’s party later?’</p><p>I couldn’t quite remember.</p><p>I had left the novel unfinished, after all.</p><p>&quot;Examiner Baek Seojin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, sorry. What were you saying? You’re from the Student Council?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. The Vice President would like to meet with you. Would you be available?&quot;</p><p>Vice President?</p><p>Not the President? Not the Treasurer?</p><p>‘…I don’t remember. Who was the Vice President again?’</p><p>Unlike the other two, I had zero recollection of this guy.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Not a single memory.</p><p>Then it hit me.</p><p>‘Oh. It’s definitely a guy.’</p><p>Because if it had been a female character, I would have remembered.</p><p>TN: It reminds me of an Overwatch clip where a guy who doesn’t play Overwatch knows all the female characters but not a single male character—not even Genji, one of the most popular ones.</p><p>&quot;He wants to meet me? Any idea why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I’m not sure. I was just asked to bring you if you agreed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Hold on a second.&quot;</p><p>I stopped her. Something about her wording bothered me.</p><p>Bring me?</p><p>That was just a polite way of saying I was supposed to go to them.</p><p>They wanted to meet me, yet I was the one expected to go to them?</p><p>&quot;No, that won’t work. Tell the Vice President to come here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Pardon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I’m not an Academy student. I’m a dispatched government official. I have a designated role, official duties. Right now, I’m on my break, but I’m still on duty. Why should I leave my station?&quot;</p><p>The Student Council had power. They were treated as elites.</p><p>That kind of prestige could lead some members to develop… an attitude.</p><p>And this Vice President?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I had a bad feeling about him already.</p><p>&quot;Tell them if they want to talk, they can come here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A-ah… understood. Let me make a call.&quot;</p><p>The student looked flustered as she hurried out.</p><p>Not her fault, really.</p><p>But if I didn’t handle this like this, that Vice President wouldn’t understand his place.</p><p>A few moments later, she returned.</p><p>&quot;The Vice President said he’ll come here instead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great. Let’s step outside. This lounge isn’t exactly ideal for a meeting.&quot;</p><p>I had a bad feeling about this.</p><p>This meeting?</p><p>Yeah… it wasn’t going to be pleasant.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>&quot;Yeah, got it. Tell him I’ll go myself.&quot;</p><p>With a smooth voice, Jung Yuhyeon ended the call.</p><p>Then—</p><p>&quot;Hah. Fucking hell.&quot;</p><p>His face twisted in irritation as he shoved his phone into his pocket.</p><p>&quot;That Silver-ranked Examiner bastard.&quot;</p><p>The newly assigned Examiner.</p><p>Some nobody from god-knows-where.</p><p>And yet, he was already a major pain in the ass.</p><p>From the moment he arrived, he had crushed every single student he examined.</p><p>Today, he even set a new record.</p><p>One match after another, he rejected every Silver promotion.</p><p>Not a single student passed.</p><p>‘Who the hell does he think he is? Some fake tough guy pretending to be strong?’</p><p>At best, he was a C-rank Awakener.</p><p>A little better than those pathetic Bronzes, sure.</p><p>But still insignificant.</p><p>Yet, here he was, acting like some big shot.</p><p>‘And now students are whining that Silver promotions suddenly got harder.’</p><p>Some people just needed to know their place.</p><p>Bronzes and Silvers were the bottom feeders of the Superhumans world.</p><p>Filthy nobodies who should be grateful for whatever scraps were thrown their way.</p><p>That was their role.</p><p>To obey. To accept their status.</p><p>Not to act like they mattered.</p><p>And this lowly bastard?</p><p>This nobody who didn’t even get into the Academy?</p><p>Now he was out here beating up Bronzes like some kind of authority?</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon wasn’t going to let that slide.</p><p>‘Checked his background. Just an orphan nobody.’</p><p>He had already done his research.</p><p>After all, being the grandson of an honorary chairman from a respectable mid-tier corporation had its perks.</p><p>And he was making full use of those connections.</p><p>‘Guess it’s time to put him in his place.’</p><p>He wasn’t just some random student.</p><p>He was the Vice President of the most powerful organization in the Academy—the Student Council.</p><p>He was almost at Platinum rank.</p><p>And unlike that orphaned street rat, his bloodline was superior.</p><p>He had every advantage.</p><p>And now, he was going to use them.</p><p>To crush this arrogant Examiner.</p><p>To bury him.</p><p>&quot;Bronzes.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 18</h1><p>I waited with the female student from the Student Council for a moment, and not long after, a male student approached.</p><p>‘Must be him.’</p><p>I expected him to bring his gang along, but to my surprise, he came alone. I wondered if that meant he had some kind of conviction, or if he was just showing utter disrespect.</p><p>The answer would come from the Third Eye.</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye.</p><p>◎ Jung Yuhyeon</p><p>An Ambusher with a Twisted Sense of Superiority</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>A classic example of bullying the weak and fearing the strong. His critical-hit rate rises when facing someone weaker than himself.</p><p>As expected. My civil-servant instincts were on point. He gave off the aura of a troublesome complainer, and his trait matched the vibe perfectly.</p><p>‘Twisted. Sense of superiority. And an Ambusher, too. Good grief…’</p><p>He was quite something in many ways.</p><p>If Ma Hakjun had his own positive “holy trinity,” this guy had a negative one. I even wondered how he landed the Vice President spot in the first place.</p><p>“Examiner.”</p><p>He was still better than a foul-mouthed troublemaker who started cursing the moment we made eye contact.</p><p>“Hello. I’m Jung Yuhyeon, serving as the Student Council Vice President.”</p><p>“Good to meet you. I’m Baek Seojin.”</p><p>While exchanging introductions, I carefully studied his gaze. His words sounded polite enough, but the look in his eyes was far from friendly. He didn’t even bother hiding it, so he clearly hadn’t come with good intentions.</p><p>“You said you wanted to see me.”</p><p>“Yes. If it’s not too much trouble, do you have a moment?”</p><p>He was worried about causing trouble, yet he was the one giving orders to bring me over.</p><p>“Let’s talk here. There aren’t any students around, and I’m reluctant to leave my post without reason.”</p><p>“Ah, I see. Then I’ll speak to you right away.”</p><p>He even sent the female student next to us away before talking. I waited quietly, and he spoke with a sharp glint in his eye.</p><p>“Give it up. What you’re doing now.”</p><p>“…I’m not sure what you mean.”</p><p>“Don’t pretend. That thing you’re doing. Acting like you’re something big in Silver promotion exams, when you’re actually nothing. I’m telling you to stop.”</p><p>In other words, he found it annoying that a mere Silver was making a fuss. No wonder the Third Eye labeled his sense of superiority as “twisted.”</p><p>He was basically saying: “Stop strutting around and picking on Bronze students when you’re just a Silver.”</p><p>“Student Jung Yuhyeon.”</p><p>I had no reason to bow my head or say, “Okay, I’ll do that.”</p><p>I was well aware the Student Council held considerable power here at the Academy.</p><p>Most students would immediately take notice if the Council appeared.</p><p>However, I wasn’t an Academy student. I was a “civil servant” dispatched here. I was operating under an official mandate, carrying out my duties, period.</p><p>“This is interference with my work. You understand that, correct?”</p><p>“….”</p><p>“The Silver promotion exams are a government-assigned duty for me. The only ones who can comment on that are the Academy Director or my own department. Even though you’re the Vice President, you’re still just a student, so you have no authority here.”</p><p>He wasn’t outright attacking me, so it wasn’t obstruction of official duty, but it was still enough to be called interference. This twisted superiority complex needed a warning.</p><p>Even if I wasn’t as powerful an superhuman being as him, he shouldn’t treat me like a student. He needed to realize that challenging me was as good as challenging state authority.</p><p>“…I apologize for bringing this up so suddenly.”</p><p>He wasn’t just a stereotypical villain with a single-digit IQ. He immediately took a step back, probably because he sensed things were turning against him.</p><p>It made sense. Otherwise, how could he have climbed to the Vice President position?</p><p>“Still, I have my reasons for acting like this.”</p><p>“Reasons?”</p><p>“Yes. Do you know how many students have failed the Silver promotion exam under your watch so far?”</p><p>Hmm. Likely around forty, but I hadn’t bothered to keep a precise count.</p><p>“It’s exactly forty-five. They’re students who need to reach Silver quickly to refocus on their studies, yet they’ve failed promotion and have to worry about it all over again.”</p><p>He sounded like someone who cared deeply about Bronze and Silver students, which was ironic for a guy so steeped in superiority. In reality, it was just a mask. He looked down on anyone beneath him.</p><p>“You may not know this, but there’s a rule at the Academy. If you remain in Bronze for too long, you get an academic warning. It’s considered proof that you aren’t making an effort to improve.”</p><p>“I’m aware.”</p><p>“And you’re still doing this? Among those forty-plus students, some may be desperate to achieve promotion.”</p><p>Admission to the superhuman Academy was difficult, and graduation was even more so. I knew how serious academic warnings were. I verified it several times before I came.</p><p>“So in other words, Vice President, you think it’s right to take it easy on them in the Silver promotion exams, for the students’ sake. Is that what I’m hearing?”</p><p>“All the other dispatched Examiners so far have done it that way. Even most of the faculty members go easy on them. You’re the only one who’s suddenly raised the bar.”</p><p>I clicked my tongue involuntarily at his words.</p><p>He was using the fact that I was a civil servant to avoid outright crushing me with rank, so he was resorting to a claim of moral high ground. Honestly, having him do this wasn’t great for me, either.</p><p>It was only a “Silver” promotion exam. Outside these walls, a Silver Examiner was nobody special. From the students’ perspective, it affected academic warnings, so letting them pass was common courtesy. He was pressuring me, insisting I was ignoring that custom and acting on my own whims.</p><p>‘He really lives up to that twisted sense of superiority, yet he’s sharp enough to serve as Vice President.’</p><p>He was using the students as leverage, building a case against me. Fine. Then I would respond in kind. I’d dealt with stubborn complainants in my civil-service days.</p><p>“Alright, Student Jung Yuhyeon. I understand your logic that you’re doing this for the sake of the students.”</p><p>“Thank you. Then….”</p><p>“However. When those students, who pass the exam with minimal effort, go out on external assignments for practical experience, what if they suddenly face real danger? Who do you think will handle it better? The ones who struggled and worked harder to get promoted, or the ones who just barely scraped through? The first group would take fewer injuries and perform more effectively, wouldn’t they?”</p><p>Just like him, I leveraged the argument about caring for the Academy students.</p><p>Which was better in the long run—preventing academic warnings, or ensuring they had grown enough to fight monsters and villains?</p><p>“That’s for them to figure out themselves.”</p><p>His response made me frown.</p><p>“If they have talent, they’ll make it. If not, so be it. There’s no reason for us to worry about that. They should handle their own survival.”</p><p>“Hang on. A moment ago, you seemed concerned about those students.”</p><p>“I’m saying if too many academic warnings pile up, it’s bad for everyone. Of course it’s bad for the students, too.”</p><p>So that was his true motive?</p><p>He wasn’t worried about the students. He was worried that a spike in academic warnings under his watch would reflect badly on him as Vice President. What a twisted piece of work.</p><p>“Student Jung Yuhyeon. I’m sorry, but our negotiation seems to be over.”</p><p>“Seems that way.”</p><p>His eyes briefly flickered. I had the sudden notion that he’d planned his words from the start, calculating when to say them.</p><p>“Then show me what you’ve got.”</p><p>“…Excuse me?”</p><p>“Your skills, Examiner Baek Seojin. I want to see if you’re strict because you genuinely have the skill, or if you’re just an outsider who couldn’t even get into the Academy and is taking out his inferiority on the students. Prove it.”</p><p>He dropped any pretense of politeness and provoked me head-on.</p><p>My troublemaker radar worked just as well at the Academy.</p><p>“You want a spar?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Sorry, but I’m only here to evaluate students, not fight them.”</p><p>If something went wrong while sparring a student, I’d get torn apart by legalities. The only thing I was authorized for was evaluating them. Sparring with a student could become a serious headache if incidents occurred.</p><p>“Are you making excuses? You go after lowly Bronzes, but run away when a tougher opponent appears. Isn’t that right, Examiner Baek Seojin?”</p><p>“Think whatever you want.”</p><p>He couldn’t stop my exams anyway. He had no authority, so he was likely trying to block me some other way. It wouldn’t work…</p><p>“Such low class. Guess you really are showing off that you have no parents.”</p><p>He muttered it loudly enough that I heard every word. Whether it was intentional or not, it was definitely said.</p><p>‘This jerk. Even saints can’t ignore that level of trash talk.’</p><p>If this was his trap, I had no choice but to step in. People here took that kind of slur very seriously. No one would just let it go.</p><p>“Alright. Let’s spar. With conditions.”</p><p>“What are they?”</p><p>“If you lose, Vice President Jung Yuhyeon, you’ll have to forfeit your current rank and drop to Bronze. You’ll only be allowed to get back to Silver by passing my exam.”</p><p>Get ready. You’ll be parked in Bronze until the day you die.</p><p>Clank—</p><p>“…What the? Where’s the Vice President?”</p><p>“He’s not here? Wow. You’re right. He was just here a while ago.”</p><p>“Hang on, Unnie. I’ll go find out.”</p><p>Yoo Dasom, the Student Council Treasurer, headed out somewhere.</p><p>Moments later…</p><p>“Unnie.”</p><p>“Yes. Did you find out?”</p><p>“Apparently, he left a little while ago.”</p><p>“Left? We have a Council meeting soon. Where did he go?”</p><p>At Yoo Dasom’s words, the girl she called Unnie frowned.</p><p>“I heard he went to see that new Examiner.”</p><p>“I’ve heard about him. So why?”</p><p>“They said the Vice President is meeting him right now.”</p><p>Hearing that, the Academy Student Council President, Kang Hana, turned icy.</p><p>‘This is troubling.’</p><p>He had decent ability and a solid background, but his superiority complex was a major problem. He looked down on ordinary people without powers, and he even belittled superhuman individuals weaker than himself. They were technically classmates, but he wasn’t someone she enjoyed dealing with. That was her conclusion about Jung Yuhyeon.</p><p>And in this situation, that haughty man went to meet the Silver Examiner?</p><p>“Dasom.”</p><p>“Yes, Unnie.”</p><p>“Let’s step out for a moment.”</p><p>“Huh? Where?”</p><p>Yoo Dasom waited for an answer, and Kang Hana responded.</p><p>“Wherever that Examiner is.”</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 19</h1><p>Student Council Vice President, Jung Yuhyeon. I hardly knew anything about him. All I knew was that he was steeped in a sense of superiority, and that his fighting style centered on ambush tactics in the Weaponry category.</p><p>And since he was in the Student Council, he had to be at least Gold rank.</p><p>He might have already reached Platinum. Outside these walls, he was probably at least B-rank, maybe even A-rank.</p><p>The moment he graduated, mid-tier Clans would be scrambling to recruit him. His superhuman abilities alone were impressive, and there was no comparing his practical battle experience to someone like Park Junwoo. Even Lee Hyunwoo, the protagonist, probably couldn’t match his level yet.</p><p>I heard a rumor about the Academy. They said, “You can bring a whole truck of Bronze and Silver folks, but we wouldn’t trade them for a single Gold.” That explained why he flaunted his superiority so boldly.</p><p>“Examiner.”</p><p>I was stretching my stiff body when Jung Yuhyeon spoke up.</p><p>“You said if I lose, I’d have to drop down to Bronze.”</p><p>He smirked when I nodded. It was a rather annoying smile. It made me want to smack him.</p><p>“Then, what if you lose, Examiner?”</p><p>“If I lose, I assume I just give in and go easy on the promotions, right?”</p><p>“No. That’s not enough for me.”</p><p>Then what did he want?</p><p>“You should apologize to every single student who failed their promotion so far.”</p><p>“…Apologize?”</p><p>“Yes. If you call yourself an Examiner who cares about the students, you should at least be willing to do that.”</p><p>He must have wanted to crush a lower-ranked outsider who didn’t know his place. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t an Academy student.</p><p>It made me wonder how someone like him ever became Vice President. There’s always one character like this, but still.</p><p>“Fine. Let’s do it that way.”</p><p>“That’s refreshingly straightforward. You may not be that skilled, but your personality—”</p><p>I cut him off before he could finish. It wasn’t worth listening to that drivel anymore. I lunged forward, throwing a punch.</p><p>Thud—</p><p>“Guh?!”</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon reeled back, clutching his face. He hadn’t even processed what just happened.</p><p>“What are you doing, Student Jung Yuhyeon?”</p><p>Didn’t he know? Vice President? A preemptive strike usually wins.</p><p>“Weren’t we starting the duel?”</p><p>When there’s no referee, if two people stand on the practice field after agreeing to fight, that is considered the start. That meant our duel was already underway.</p><p>“….”</p><p>Drip—</p><p>It seemed my blow really landed. I hadn’t expected him to start bleeding from the nose, but there it was. It was coming out of both nostrils. The Vice President who had been bragging moments ago looked pretty pathetic.</p><p>“Y-you bastard!”</p><p>He had clearly lost his temper over that unexpected first strike. He had been keeping up appearances before, but now he was cursing and rushing in.</p><p>Swish—!</p><p>Something glinted from both of his wrists. I dodged on reflex, and a chill grazed my side. If I had been any slower, those daggers would have sunk right into my torso.</p><p>“I was going to go easy on you since you’re just a pathetic third-rate superhuman, but you’re not worth it.”</p><p>Why was he speaking like some cliched third-rate villain? Even modern villains wouldn’t bother with such outdated lines. He was angry enough to lose it completely after taking a single hit from someone he had looked down on.</p><p>“Hoo.”</p><p>I took a breath as I watched him pull out another pair of daggers.</p><p>This time, I had to remember that my opponent wasn’t just some Bronze like Lee Hyunwoo. Nor was he someone like Park Junwoo, who still ended up at Bronze after a forced demotion.</p><p>He was already recognized as Gold rank, which was impressive. Meanwhile, my Trait was Gatekeeper, specifically “Silver” Gatekeeper. In theory, it shouldn’t have worked on him, since he had already reached Gold.</p><p>◎ Sole Examiner</p><p>Trait Activated.</p><p>Target is someone who did not receive promotion from Baek Seojin. Recognized as an examinee.</p><p>Without that Trait, I wouldn’t stand a chance.</p><p>No matter if Jung Yuhyeon was Gold or B-rank, it didn’t matter. At this moment, he was only an examinee stuck at Bronze, just like Lee Hyunwoo or Park Junwoo striving for Silver.</p><p>Another pair of daggers flew toward me, but I dodged them without much effort. They were quick, but not so fast that I couldn’t react. It was a bit like dodging a soccer ball kicked from a distance.</p><p>“You dodge like a snake.”</p><p>Apparently deciding that throwing daggers wouldn’t work, he reached into his coat. I thought he was going to hurl something my way, but then he dropped two glass vials at his own feet.</p><p>Crash—</p><p>Suddenly, dark smoke rose, filling my vision.</p><p>Ssssshh—</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>It reminded me of thick fog mixed with black paint. I couldn’t see a thing, not even an inch ahead.</p><p>‘Behind me.’</p><p>I twisted my body in haste, and right then, searing pain throbbed in my side. My hand came away bloody when I touched it. If I hadn’t turned in time, I might have been critically wounded.</p><p>I tried to see where the dagger had come from, but there was nothing except swirling black smoke. It didn’t seem close to clearing, either.</p><p>“Is that an item made from some monster byproduct?”</p><p>Given his Trait, I’d expect him to prepare thoroughly. He was blocking my vision to land a critical strike. Without allies drawing my aggro, this was how he fought. I hated his attitude, but his combat sense was solid. He hadn’t reached Gold by chance.</p><p>However…</p><p>I realized that I wasn’t hopelessly at a disadvantage.</p><p>Ambush tactics are best when your target is clueless and off guard, so you can land a single blow that prevents any resistance. No matter how much he obscured my view, I already knew he was out there somewhere. It wasn’t a perfect ambush.</p><p>Swish—!</p><p>Behind me again. One clean hit would mean a severe injury. That was a vicious attack, but it missed me entirely.</p><p>He was faster than Lee Hyunwoo or Park Junwoo, and it was obvious he belonged in the Student Council. There was no question that he was quick.</p><p>He was a turtle compared to the Elder who had beaten me senseless some time ago, though. That Elder’s spear felt like it came from every angle at impossible speeds. I still remembered the moment I got hit. It left me with a sense that dodging an attack like this wasn’t nearly as difficult.</p><p>This black smoke likely wouldn’t last forever. He probably knew he couldn’t drag things out. He was drunk on his own superiority, so he would want to end it before the smoke cleared. Failing to end me while hidden in darkness would be humiliating for an ambush specialist.</p><p>Swish—! Swish—!</p><p>“From behind once, my side twice, then my thigh once.”</p><p>He was throwing daggers like they were random, but there was a pattern. He wouldn’t suspect that I’d notice.</p><p>‘…Now.’</p><p>Another dagger flew toward my side. He probably assumed I’d dodge again, but I didn’t do it this time.</p><p>Grab—</p><p>“Gah?!”</p><p>I snatched his wrist, and his whole body came with it. He must have believed that as a Gold, he was toying with a mere Silver Examiner. He looked at me in shock, certain I was in the palm of his hand.</p><p>“Screw that.”</p><p>I smashed my fist into his face with all my strength, a bit harder than I had hit Park Junwoo’s ribs before.</p><p>Crunch—</p><p>“Guhh!”</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon rolled on the ground, clutching his nose. The nosebleed that had stopped was flowing freely again. At the perfect moment, the black smoke he had released began to dissipate.</p><p>“Urgh… y-you piece of shit…”</p><p>Cursing under his breath, he clutched his dagger and forced himself up.</p><p>That was the point where other students would usually admit defeat. They would acknowledge they’d done everything they could, accept their lack of skill, and move on from their failed promotion.</p><p>Park Junwoo and a few other thugs didn’t make it that far because I pummeled them first, but that was a separate matter.</p><p>“Student Jung Yuhyeon. Are you going to continue?”</p><p>I looked at him as he stood there, nose bleeding. As an Examiner, I felt we’d gone far enough, but as a person, I still felt like I owed him more payback.</p><p>He had tossed out that parent-related slur earlier, and I hadn’t really paid him back for it.</p><p>“Of course! You, I’ll definitely—”</p><p>“No, Examiner. Let’s end it here.”</p><p>I was about to keep going when someone else’s voice halted my punch.</p><p>“Stop it too, Jung Yuhyeon.”</p><p>“Who the hell… President?”</p><p>President? I turned toward the source of the voice at his mutter.</p><p>It was a tall female student and a slightly shorter female student standing beside her. I wasn’t sure how long they’d been watching, but it didn’t look like they had just arrived.</p><p>“Hello, Examiner Baek Seojin. This is our first time meeting. I’m Kang Hana, Student Council President.”</p><p>“Hi there! I’m Yoo Dasom, the Student Council Treasurer!”</p><p>I couldn’t believe we now had the President and Treasurer after the Vice President. Jung Yuhyeon suddenly shouted.</p><p>“President! Why are you telling me to stop? I’m not finished—”</p><p>“Cut it out, Jung Yuhyeon. You look pathetic.”</p><p>“What…?”</p><p>“You’re smearing the Student Council’s reputation. Consider this your final warning. Close your mouth.”</p><p>She silenced him so fast. Then she turned her stern gaze toward me.</p><p>“Examiner Baek Seojin, I’d appreciate it if we could end things here.”</p><p>“He says he can still fight.”</p><p>“Is that so? Jung Yuhyeon, you really want to keep going?”</p><p>He bit his lip, but ultimately backed down.</p><p>He was the type to behave around anyone stronger or higher in status.</p><p>“That settles it, Examiner.”</p><p>“Then what about the condition I mentioned?”</p><p>“Condition?”</p><p>It seemed Kang Hana didn’t know about that part yet.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon shouted, “Wait!” too late. There was no way I’d let him off without settling that score.</p><p>“I told him if he lost, he’d drop to Bronze rank.”</p><p>“…Drop to Bronze?”</p><p>“Yes. He said it himself.”</p><p>Kang Hana studied me for a moment, then turned her attention to Jung Yuhyeon.</p><p>“Is that true?”</p><p>“P-President. This is, um…”</p><p>“Is it true or not?”</p><p>He nodded, much to my surprise. I’d expected him to deny it.</p><p>“Hah.”</p><p>Kang Hana heaved a deep sigh, then spoke in a cold tone.</p><p>“Jung Yuhyeon. You’re on probation. Don’t come to the Student Council for a while. Keep your head down.”</p><p>“President!”</p><p>“I’ll report this to the Director separately. I’ll have them revoke your rank and drop you to Bronze.”</p><p>“Kang Hana!!”</p><p>“That’s it. We’re done here.”</p><p>As I watched her shut him down so decisively, I thought, ‘There was a reason she was the Student Council President.’</p>"

Your nose won’t stop bleeding.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not over yet! My limbs are fine, so how the hell is this a loss?!&quot;</p><p>If he was such a hotshot Gold, shouldn’t he at least have the dignity to accept defeat? Getting a double nosebleed—twice, no less—was more than enough proof that he lost.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon tried to charge at me in a fit of rage. But Yoo Dasom, the Student Council Treasurer, had him in a tight grip, holding him back.</p><p>&quot;Let go! Let me go, Yoo Dasom! I said, let go!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Calm down. If you keep this up, someone’s going to get seriously hurt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damn it! Hey, Yoo Dasom! You hear me?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Loud and clear. But I’m more scared of the President than I am of you. So…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gah?!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stay put, will you?&quot;</p><p>At first glance, it looked like a back hug.</p><p>But a closer look? It was more like a chokehold.</p><p>The sight of a grown man struggling in the grip of a much smaller girl was absurd. Was Jung Yuhyeon just weak? Or was Yoo Dasom oddly strong?</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Yoo Dasom</p><p>The Angel of the Frontlines</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>A person who prioritizes others over herself. Healing abilities increase the closer she gets to the Frontline. Possesses a steadfast spirit.</p><p>Yoo Dasom was a support-type Superhuman, specifically a healer—an incredibly rare one. But &quot;Angel of the Frontlines&quot;? And her healing got stronger the closer she was to the battlefield?</p><p>Wasn’t she someone who should be protected in the backline? Could she really afford to fight like this?</p><p>‘…Oh. Maybe that’s why she trained her physical abilities so much?’</p><p>That explained why Jung Yuhyeon was struggling so much.</p><p>A Weaponry-type like him, who relied on ambushing from the side or rear while allies distracted the enemy… Versus a support-type like her, who had to be at the frontlines to maximize her abilities.</p><p>Naturally, Yoo Dasom was far more likely to face monsters and villains head-on than Jung Yuhyeon. Between the two, it was obvious who had put more effort into physical conditioning.</p><p>&quot;Grrr! President! This isn’t right! Cough! That guy’s an outsider! We’re the Academy’s Student Council! This is—ugh!&quot;</p><p>Since he couldn’t escape by force, he was trying to talk his way out of it. But Kang Hana let out a deep sigh and stepped forward.</p><p>…Shaa—</p><p>Cold magic gathered in one of her hands.</p><p>&quot;And that’s exactly why I’m letting you off with just this much, Jung Yuhyeon. If you were really part of the Student Council—if you were truly the Vice President—then instead of whining about the match, you’d know when to shut up.&quot;</p><p>She grabbed him by the collar and muttered in an eerily quiet voice. Her expression practically screamed, ‘Say one more word, and you’ll regret it.’</p><p>Even Jung Yuhyeon, who had been barking loudly just moments ago, had no choice but to back down.</p><p>&quot;Go home. As I said, you’re on probation. Don’t show your face around the Student Council for a while.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…Fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dasom, let him go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it, Unni. Oh, Vice President, your injuries—&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forget it. I’ll handle it myself.&quot;</p><p>His voice was weak as he walked past Yoo Dasom and Kang Hana. But the moment he passed by me, he shot me a venomous glare.</p><p>&quot;You… I’ll make sure—&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said, leave.&quot;</p><p>Idiot. One word from Kang Hana, and he instantly shrank away like a whipped dog. He looked down on Bronzes and Silvers, but the moment he faced someone stronger, he turned into a sniveling coward.</p><p>How did someone like him even make it to Vice President? If he were just a department head, I’d understand, but Vice President?</p><p>‘…Something about this doesn’t sit right.’</p><p>People like him always vow revenge. And in my opinion, Jung Yuhyeon was definitely the type to hold a grudge.</p><p>As long as he saw me as beneath him, he would try to crush me. If he couldn’t beat me with skill, he’d resort to underhanded tactics. Maybe he’d even use political pressure.</p><p>Whatever it was, it wouldn’t be anything good for me.</p><p>&quot;What an embarrassing display.&quot;</p><p>As I watched Jung Yuhyeon walk away, unease settled in my gut. Then, Kang Hana approached and gave me a slight nod.</p><p>&quot;Let me properly introduce myself. I’m Kang Hana, Student Council President and a third-year at the Academy.&quot;</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Kang Hana</p><p>A Flame Within the Ice</p><p>◎ Details:</p><p>Controls the coldest magic, yet carries a passion hotter than fire. Magic power increases in lower temperatures. Magic weakens temporarily in excessively hot environments. Possesses a steadfast spirit.</p><p>Another one with a positive description, like Yoo Dasom.</p><p>Well, of course. If she weren’t a decent person, she wouldn’t have put Jung Yuhyeon in his place. If she were anything like him, I would’ve been the one being targeted instead.</p><p>&quot;I want to apologize. If the Vice President said anything inappropriate, please understand that his views do not reflect the Student Council as a whole. His words were purely his own.&quot;</p><p>A clean and decisive disavowal. I could respect that. It was clear she wasn’t fond of Jung Yuhyeon either.</p><p>In that case… maybe I could vent just a little?</p><p>&quot;That’s a relief. He did make a rather inappropriate comment that left a bad taste in my mouth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Inappropriate? What did he say…?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He told me I was ‘acting like someone without parents.’&quot;</p><p>&quot;…What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p><p>Kang Hana and Yoo Dasom’s faces twisted in disbelief.</p><p>&quot;It’s a real shame for an orphan to hear something like that, isn’t it?&quot;</p><p>He knew I was an orphan and still made that remark. That realization left them at a complete loss for words.</p><p>Mocking someone who had lost their parents? At this point, cutting ties with him entirely would be more than justified.</p><p>&quot;That bastard.&quot;</p><p>Kang Hana bit her lip in frustration, clearly seething.</p><p>From the looks of it, even within the Student Council, Jung Yuhyeon must have been relatively well-behaved. Otherwise, Kang Hana wouldn’t have been so blindsided by this.</p><p>I could practically hear the sound of his reputation crumbling.</p><p>&quot;I sincerely apologize, Examiner. As Student Council President, I take full responsibility—&quot;</p><p>&quot;It’s fine. It annoyed me a bit, but beating him up helped me vent.&quot;</p><p>At my words, Yoo Dasom suddenly burst into laughter. Was she picturing him with that ridiculous double nosebleed?</p><p>&quot;Wait, Examiner, are you injured?&quot;</p><p>Following her gaze, I noticed blood soaking through my side.</p><p>It had only felt like a light scratch, but I guess the ambush was sharper than I thought.</p><p>Yoo Dasom pointed to my side, and when I looked down, I saw blood seeping through my clothes. I had only felt a mild sting and assumed it was a shallow cut. But as expected of an ambush specialist—his attacks had been sharper than I realized.</p><p>&quot;Hold on, I’ll heal you right away.&quot;</p><p>Yoo Dasom stepped closer and placed her hand over the wound. A soft glow flickered, and in an instant, a burning sensation spread through my side. Before I could stop myself, a quiet groan escaped my lips.</p><p>&quot;Ah—&quot;</p><p>Yoo Dasom smiled.</p><p>&quot;It might feel hot or a little painful, but that just means the healing is working well. Don’t worry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Amazing. So this is how wounds heal?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait… Have you never been treated by a support-type before?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Probably not. At least, not while I was fully conscious.&quot;</p><p>At my response, Yoo Dasom made a strange expression. I wasn’t sure why, but Kang Hana, standing beside her, had the same reaction.</p><p>Why were they acting like this? Was it such a big deal to have never received healing before?</p><p>&quot;Wait, you’re serious? You’ve never been healed by a support-type?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lies! No way!&quot;</p><p>I wasn’t lying. I had never once received healing from a support-type.</p><p>Maybe they were wondering if I had gotten treated after getting beaten down by the Elder.</p><p>But I had been unconscious the entire time, so I wouldn’t remember even if I had.</p><p>&quot;With the way you fought in that duel, you must have spent time in real combat!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dasom’s right. Honestly, we both thought you weren’t just a new Examiner. We figured you were originally a field operative who got injured and transferred to a desk job.&quot;</p><p>I had heard of cases like that before.</p><p>When field agents became too injured to continue combat roles, they were sometimes reassigned to administrative positions as compensation.</p><p>&quot;But I’m a civil servant, you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh… that’s true.&quot;</p><p>It wasn’t uncommon for an injured field agent to be reassigned within their own organization. But someone becoming a government employee without even taking the civil service exam? Impossible.</p><p>&quot;Examiner, you really are something else! Could it be that you’re…&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know, like those secret agents in movies! A hidden government weapon,</p><p>trained in the shadows and now pretending to be a normal person while carrying out classified missions!&quot;</p><p>A secret government weapon? More like a government slave.</p><p>Or maybe the ultimate warrior doomed to battle an endless army of disgruntled citizens.</p><p>Beep—</p><p>&quot;Unni, it’s time for the Student Council meeting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Already? I didn’t realize. Examiner, we’ll be heading out now. See you again soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure. But you really don’t have to—&quot;</p><p>&quot;We do. We need to make sure the Vice President’s demotion is properly handled. I’ll personally ensure he gets dropped to Bronze.&quot;</p><p>At Kang Hana’s words, I cheered internally and clapped in my mind.</p><p>Welcome back, Jung Yuhyeon. It’s been a while since you breathed Bronze air, hasn’t it? You’ll be here for a long time, so get comfortable.</p><p>&quot;…Something seems off, doesn’t it?&quot;</p><p>On their way back to the Student Council office, Yoo Dasom spoke up. Kang Hana, walking silently beside her, gave a small nod.</p><p>&quot;We didn’t see most of the fight because of the Vice President’s item… But that final move—that wasn’t something a regular Silver-rank Examiner should be capable of.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly. If he had reacted even a second later, his back would have been skewered.&quot;</p><p>Student Council Treasurer, Yoo Dasom—support-type, Gold rank.</p><p>Student Council President, Kang Hana—magic-type, Platinum rank.</p><p>Both were stronger than Jung Yuhyeon, not weaker. Yet even to them, Baek Seojin’s movements had been extraordinary.</p><p>&quot;Could he really be one of those?&quot;</p><p>&quot;One of what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What I said earlier. A secret government-trained Superhuman.</p><p>Not for handling Gates or monsters, but specifically for dealing with villains.&quot;</p><p>&quot;…That’s ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>Kang Hana dismissed it outright.</p><p>But she wasn’t entirely convinced.</p><p>‘Should I look into it?’</p><p>After all, her father was the Clan Master of Tower of Magic, one of South Korea’s top-ranking clans. A powerhouse filled with elite Superhuman. If she wanted, she could ask them to investigate.</p><p>‘…No. That would be way too rude. I shouldn’t.’</p><p>Shaking her head, Kang Hana continued walking, listening to Yoo Dasom’s chatter.</p><p>Still—she couldn’t deny it.</p><p>Baek Seojin was becoming more and more intriguing.</p>"

His strikes targeted only vital points—cold, calculated, and lethal.</p><p>He was still a student, but he could already be classified as a B-rank Superhuman.</p><p>Even with my Silver Gatekeeper trait and my Sole Examiner trait working at full efficiency, that duel had been anything but easy.</p><p>If it weren’t for my previous encounter with an Elder, it would have been much harder.</p><p>Ironically, getting beaten to a pulp by that monster ended up helping me.</p><p>The speed, the power, the sheer brutality. After surviving that, Jung Yuhyeon’s attacks felt manageable in comparison.</p><p>If I hadn’t had that experience, adapting to his combat style would have taken much longer.</p><p>‘Wait… why is it so quiet?’</p><p>Just earlier, students had been lining up in droves for evaluations. Now, not a single one was left.</p><p>At first, I thought classes were still ongoing, so I looked around the Academy.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>The hallways were packed with students, chatting away. Some were even getting their rank evaluations from assistant examiners.</p><p>I thought, Maybe there aren’t any more Silver candidates today?</p><p>But that wasn’t the case either.</p><p>I could see an assistant examiner conducting a Silver rank evaluation right now. At least five students were still waiting in line behind them.</p><p>Did they not realize I was available?</p><p>I went back to my seat and waited.</p><p>Nobody came.</p><p>Two students did approach—</p><p>But the moment they saw me, they blurted out, &quot;Oh! Sorry! Wrong place!&quot; and scurried off.</p><p>‘What the hell is going on?’</p><p>I sat there, waiting, dumbfounded.</p><p>Ten minutes passed.</p><p>Thirty minutes.</p><p>An hour.</p><p>Still, no one.</p><p>I checked the time.</p><p>Only thirty minutes left until I clocked out.</p><p>Normally, that would have had me celebrating.</p><p>No overtime, no late shifts—just a clean exit at the end of the day. That was the one good thing about this government-assigned post.</p><p>But today, for some reason, something felt… off.</p><p>&quot;Examiner.&quot;</p><p>A small, hesitant voice.</p><p>But I had heard it enough times by now to recognize it instantly.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon.&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon glanced around nervously before stepping closer.</p><p>Her Third Eye trait still showed the same as before—A Genius Consumed by Inferiority.</p><p>I hadn’t expected that to change overnight.</p><p>Still, I had held onto a tiny bit of hope.</p><p>&quot;Where is everyone?&quot;</p><p>Did she really have to point it out?</p><p>&quot;Yeah. There were tons of students earlier, but now they’re all gone. No idea why.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Actually… I think I might know the reason.&quot;</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>I gave her a look that said, Go on.</p><p>&quot;Well… I overheard some students saying that getting evaluated by you is…&quot;</p><p>&quot;That it’s what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;…A waste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A waste?&quot;</p><p>What kind of nonsense was that?</p><p>&quot;Yeah. They said that all the other examiners just pass students with minimal effort. But you’re so strict that nobody gets promoted, so they’d rather go to someone else.&quot;</p><p>I was at a complete loss for words.</p><p>I didn’t do anything wrong! I was just doing my job properly!</p><p>If they wanted to pass so easily, why even have a rank evaluation in the first place? Wasn’t the whole point to determine who was actually ready?!</p><p>&quot;Are you sure they really said that? That they’d rather avoid me altogether?&quot;</p><p>I grabbed Kim Suhyeon’s shoulders, pressing for answers.</p><p>Maybe she misheard. Maybe it was just a small group of students.</p><p>&quot;No… I think most of them feel that way.&quot;</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>This was bad.</p><p>Even after conducting dozens of evaluations today, my Gatekeeper trait hadn’t registered a new advancement requirement.</p><p>I had assumed there would always be a steady stream of students coming in. There were plenty of Bronzes who needed to rank up to Silver, after all.</p><p>The Academy staff also conducted evaluations, but their priority was teaching,</p><p>so I had expected more than half of the students to come to me.</p><p>But now?</p><p>With them deliberately avoiding me, my own growth was at risk.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon would keep progressing, sure. But what about me?</p><p>I had already faced Han Jiyoon, Ma Hakjun, Kang Minseong, Irina—And even that Elder, one of the most terrifying villains out there.</p><p>I had to keep growing stronger.</p><p>I had already done too much. Made too many enemies. There was no turning back.</p><p>Should I start going easy on them?</p><p>No.</p><p>That wasn’t an option.</p><p>The Gatekeeper trait was literally about blocking promotions. If I went against that, I would only be hurting myself in the long run.</p><p>‘At least I’ve got one guaranteed Bronze who has no choice but to take my evaluation.’</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon.</p><p>That bastard wasn’t passing anytime soon.</p><p>Making a joke like that in front of a Korean? That was beyond crossing the line.</p><p>&quot;Wait! Hold on! Examiner, is that… is that blood?!&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s panicked voice snapped me out of my thoughts.</p><p>I sighed and glanced down at my side.</p><p>Oh. Right.</p><p>Yoo Dasom had healed me, but my clothes were still covered in dried blood.</p><p>&quot;You’re injured?! What happened?! Is it bad?! We need to get you to the infirmary—&quot;</p><p>&quot;It’s fine. I already got treated. Look.&quot;</p><p>To prove it, I pressed down hard on my side.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon gasped.</p><p>&quot;Seriously, it’s healed. I just haven’t changed my clothes yet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But how did you get hurt?! Wait… did this happen during an evaluation?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not exactly. I was sparring with a student, and—&quot;</p><p>Damn. I shouldn’t have said that.</p><p>The moment I stopped talking, her eyes widened.</p><p>&quot;A duel? With who? Who did this to you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It’s really nothing. Just a small—&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tell me. Who was it?&quot;</p><p>Somehow, Kim Suhyeon&#39;s voice was growing colder.</p><p>And was it just my imagination, or were her eyes… glimmering red?</p><p>‘Am I imagining things?’</p><p>I tried to brush it off.</p><p>I repeatedly reassured Kim Suhyeon that it was nothing. That she didn’t need to worry.</p><p>But unlike her usual self, she wouldn&#39;t drop it.</p><p>She insisted.</p><p>Who had done it? Who was responsible for my injury? She demanded an answer.</p><p>‘I can’t keep dodging this.’</p><p>I was already worried about her development.</p><p>And with the situation with Jung Yuhyeon, I figured it was best to be honest with her.</p><p>&quot;The Student Council’s Vice President. I think his name was Jung Yuhyeon? I sparred with him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jung Yuhyeon. The Vice President.&quot;</p><p>Even as I said it, I wondered if this was a mistake.</p><p>But there was no taking it back now.</p><p>What’s done is done.</p><p>&quot;Why did you duel him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There was a disagreement, and we couldn’t resolve it with words. So, we settled it with a match.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the result…?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you think? Suhyeon, do you think I won? Or do you think I lost?&quot;</p><p>The Student Council, even at the lowest level, was at least Gold-ranked.</p><p>Not a newly promoted Silver, but a fully recognized Gold.</p><p>Yet, Kim Suhyeon didn’t hesitate for even a second.</p><p>&quot;Examiner, you definitely won.&quot;</p><p>I wasn&#39;t her family. I wasn’t her lover. But she had unwavering confidence in me.</p><p>And that… was oddly comforting.</p><p>&quot;So? Was I right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Obviously, I won.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course!&quot; she grinned.</p><p>I was about to tell her how I had beaten him, but then—</p><p>I slipped up.</p><p>&quot;That bastard said I ‘looked like an orphan.’ So I—&quot;</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>I shouldn’t have said that.</p><p>I had heard it from Kang Minseong.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon lost her mother when she was young.</p><p>Her mother had been a superhuman—a hero—who died fighting villains.</p><p>And now, here I was, casually mentioning that in front of her.</p><p>&quot;What… what did you just say, Examiner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#39;Looked like an orphan,&#39;&quot; she repeated, her voice chilling.</p><p>&quot;Ah, well… you know… Since I don’t have parents, I guess he thought it was funny.&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s eyes darkened.</p><p>No. Not just darkened.</p><p>They glowed.</p><p>A deep, burning red.</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>A Genius Consumed by Inferiority</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>All abilities are temporarily reduced. Prolonged inferiority could result in permanent power loss. Improper development could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p>◎ Alert</p><p>A Seed has been Planted.</p><p>Seed Type - Wrath.</p><p>I screwed up.</p><p>I seriously, seriously screwed up.</p><p>***</p><p>Grit—</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon ground his teeth, stuffing tissues into his nose as he seethed.</p><p>He had been pacing angrily for a while now, barely able to contain himself.</p><p>Then, finally, he yanked out his phone.</p><p>&quot;Hyung. No need for small talk. I need a favor.&quot;</p><p>His voice was sharp, his breath ragged.</p><p>&quot;Take care of someone for me. I’ll pay.&quot;</p><p>There was a brief silence on the other end.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon exhaled sharply.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll give you a share of my stake. That should be enough, right? Just get rid of him completely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...No, I’m not saying you have to kill him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Break him. Cripple him. Bury him socially, make sure he can’t recover. Whatever works.&quot;</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>The voice on the other end said something that made Jung Yuhyeon&#39;s expression twist.</p><p>His lips curled into a sneer.</p><p>&quot;...Fine. Frame him for something. Throw a girl at him, accuse him of assault, whatever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just make sure he disappears from my sight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m serious. Take the deal, and I&#39;ll transfer the shares.&quot;</p><p>Click.</p><p>He ended the call and tossed his phone onto the couch.</p><p>Then, tilting his head back, he let out a slow, shuddering breath.</p><p>At first, he had thought about letting it slide.</p><p>But that bastard had humiliated him.</p><p>There was no walking away from this.</p><p>Lesser beings must be crushed.</p><p>That was the rule.</p><p>Understanding was weakness. Mercy was a joke. Sympathy was poison.</p><p>Crush them. Break them. Make them kneel.</p><p>His grandfather had told him that once.</p><p>And Jung Yuhyeon never forgot his lessons.</p><p>&quot;Baek Seojin, Baek Seojin, Baek Seojin….&quot;</p><p>That orphaned filth.</p><p>That miserable, pathetic nobody.</p><p>He had dared to challenge him?</p><p>He had dared to defy him?</p><p>No.</p><p>That bastard was going to learn what happens to people like him.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon would make sure of it.</p><p>Yuyu: Some people just don&#39;t know when to rest 🤦</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 22</h1><p>“I’m home.”</p><p>Baek Seojin was an orphan. In other words, there was no one around now to reply to this greeting. Even so, this habit was stubborn and refused to go away.</p><p>Maybe it was a quirk the old Baek Seojin developed out of loneliness. After finishing a hard day and returning home, he probably waited for someone to welcome him. Now that I had become Baek Seojin, I was carrying on that habit.</p><p>“Hoo…”</p><p>I felt unusually exhausted today. It was as if my superior had cracked down on me like crazy.</p><p>My body was weary from judging those kids for their exams, plus sparring with Jung Yuhyeon. My mind was frazzled thanks to Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>“I’m about to lose it. What is this seed that supposedly got planted, anyway?”</p><p>The moment I saw the detailed info through the Third Eye, I was floored.</p><p>I barely stopped her from getting dragged off by the Elder, twisting that future where she would become the Crimson Witch. Then it turned out the seed that got planted was called ‘Wrath.’ That was making me really uneasy.</p><p>It was driving me crazier to think it happened because of me. I went to all that trouble. I hoped I didn’t end up ruining what I had just saved. I regretted bringing it up at all. I should have kept my mouth shut instead of blurting it out.</p><p>At least one bit of luck was that her trait remained exactly the same so far. If I had triggered her transformation into the Crimson Witch by mistake, her trait would have changed right away. Before we parted, I made sure to check and saw that nothing had shifted.</p><p>I told myself it was probably nothing and that I should relax. It was only wrath for someone else’s sake, so maybe it wouldn’t be a big deal. It wasn’t as though she was furious at the entire world or the human race as a whole.</p><p>“I should keep an eye on Kim Suhyeon starting tomorrow. I want to be absolutely sure nothing is wrong.”</p><p>I had planned to recommend a Silver exam for her soon anyway. If I made use of that ‘No Pain No Gain’ trait, it might become an incredible source of power for her. If the Crimson Witch sided with us, it would be a huge advantage.</p><p>Though she couldn’t jump straight to Silver the way Lee Hyunwoo did.</p><p>She needed to stack up as much as possible before heading up. That way, even if her rank was Silver, she could potentially aim for Gold or beyond.</p><p>She might rise to Silver and still fight evenly against Gold-level foes. That could change her outlook in an instant, especially considering her current struggles with inferiority. And maybe Lee Hyunwoo could also ascend faster if he leapt forward at the right moment.</p><p>All of that could happen if students took the Silver exam often enough.</p><p>“I wish the other kids would avoid taking the easy way out and start looking further ahead.”</p><p>It crossed my mind that maybe I was expecting too much from the students. They had no idea what was coming in the future. Disasters beyond imagination would descend on the world, completely unlike anything happening now.</p><p>I didn’t know the details, either. Unfortunately, I had only skimmed the story before finding myself in this body.</p><p>I took a shower, got changed, and threw together something quick for dinner. I had barely done anything since coming home, yet I felt sluggish already.</p><p>I wondered how people managed to go straight to the gym after work. Some of them worked out before going to work, then went to their jobs, then returned to the gym again in the evening.</p><p>“Those folks are built differently. It’s impossible for ordinary humans.”</p><p>It was a problem. I realized I really should start exercising, but I felt no closer to it.</p><p>The Silver Gatekeeper trait allowed me to push my body to its limit, but it also caused me to feel that double fatigue setting in. My basic stamina was still holding up, yet if I misstepped once, it could all fall apart.</p><p>They always said that building endurance was as tough as collecting mileage, and losing it happened in an instant.</p><p>“Still, here I am plopping myself down in front of a computer, so maybe I’m the crazy one.”</p><p>There was nothing I could do about it. The old Baek Seojin and I both had the same habit: sitting down at the computer as soon as we got home from work.</p><p>From the moment I opened my eyes for my commute until I got off work, it was nothing but stress, stress, and more stress. At least gaming offered a slight release.</p><p>It felt like it only relieved about ten points of stress, then added back eighty, but commuting built it up to around five hundred, so it was worth it.</p><p>[Game Launching.]</p><p>I remembered my amazement that the same game I used to play actually existed here, exactly the same.</p><p>“Legend of League,” the most popular AOS game around.</p><p>It was the place that had been stained with my tears and frustration, all for a chance at advancing to Silver.</p><p>Apparently, the old Baek Seojin had played this game too. Unlike me, he managed to escape Bronze. Technically, now that I was Baek Seojin, I guess I was the one who reached Silver.</p><p>I had been stunned at first. My dream was to reach Silver just once, and it came true in a bizarre way. Anyway, the old Baek Seojin—no, the me of this world—had crossed the deep, treacherous river known as Bronze.</p><p>“It’s been a while since I logged in.”</p><p>I realized it might have been nearly two weeks since I last played.</p><p>Right before my Academy dispatch, I had so much overtime that I practically blacked out as soon as I got home. Then when overtime eased up, I got sent to the Academy. Then the Academy got attacked and I ended up in the hospital.</p><p>“PleaseLetMeSilver”</p><p>That was my username. It was almost too on the nose. It felt as if the old me and the old Baek Seojin had joined forces to come up with it. Now I had ended up surpassing Bronze and stepping into Silver.</p><p>I intended to just queue for a single normal match to get the first-win bonus and then call it a night. I still had work tomorrow and was already feeling worn out.</p><p>I was in Silver now, so I didn’t see the need to grind for a higher rank. My original goal was always escaping Bronze. I knew my limitations better than anyone and doubted I could pull off more than that.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Click—</p><p>Why was I hovering over Ranked instead of Normals? Did my hand slip? Or did my muscle memory automatically pick Ranked?</p><p>[Searching for a game.]</p><p>I planned to cancel right away. There was no point in playing if I ran into a bunch of beasts…</p><p>[Game found!]</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>I hesitated for a moment. There was no major penalty if I canceled now. I rarely ever did this.</p><p>“Why am I…?”</p><p>The Confirm button looked strangely tempting. I felt myself drawn to it.</p><p>***</p><p>[ ‘Madcat’ is Live: Today I Must Reach Silver ]</p><p>[Hiya]</p><p>(Madcat’s hello emoticon)</p><p>[Hiya]</p><p>(Madcat’s hello emoticon)</p><p>[Wow, she’s Brooooooonze!!]</p><p>[Hiya]</p><p>(Madcat’s hello emoticon)</p><p>Madcat was a streamer who mostly did chat and karaoke content, with quite a large following. She was known for having witty banter and easily switching between laid-back and cutesy. Until recently, she had been broadcasting happy streams.</p><p>“Hello, everyone. No need for a long intro. I’m going to focus really hard today. I stayed up late last night to get to two wins and two losses. I just need one more win for Silver, then I can ascend in peace, so nobody stop me.”</p><p>[Hahaha]</p><p>[You think it’ll happen? Haha]</p><p>[No way you’re getting Silver]</p><p>She had been going through a brutal experience lately because of a sudden mission that popped up.</p><p>[ Legend of League: Achieve ‘Silver’</p><p>327 hours 57 minutes – Prize: 2,000,000 won ]</p><p>It started as a casual request while she was chatting about the game.</p><p>It hadn’t started off so huge. The initial offer was just 30,000 won.</p><p>Madcat wasn’t that interested in gaming content, so she had intended to decline.</p><p>However, the amount kept going up until it surpassed one million and then two million won, and there were additional side missions attached to hitting Silver, climbing to nearly five million total. Even top-tier streamers couldn’t turn away that kind of money.</p><p>“Once I finish this mission, I’m uninstalling. Raaagh!”</p><p>She slammed her desk and shouted, then after a moment, there was a loud pounding followed by the door behind her opening.</p><p>- Ah, the noise!</p><p>- FBI! Open up!!</p><p>Thanks to her webcam angle, it was hard to see exactly what was happening. A man’s voice could be heard faintly in the background.</p><p>Soon, Madcat returned, snarling in annoyance.</p><p>“Fine, I’m sorry already. You make noise during your own stream too. Ugh, get out. I’ll keep quiet.”</p><p>She chased him out, let out a big sigh, and sat down again. The viewers in chat started spamming one particular name.</p><p>[Clover!]</p><p>[Clover!]</p><p>[Clover, show your face before you go]</p><p>[Haha, the older brother was a pro, but the sister is stuck in Bronze]</p><p>It wasn’t her husband or boyfriend. The man scolding her was actually her older brother. He was the recently retired pro-gamer “Clover” of Legend of League, a genuine star who had claimed multiple championships in the domestic league.</p><p>That was why someone placed that game mission on Madcat’s stream. Viewers teased that it made no sense for a pro-gamer’s sister to be unranked.</p><p>She had insisted that it was none of their business, but all was fair when big donations came into play. Besides, she thought that reaching Silver would be easy, given her pro-gamer brother. Turning the offer down wouldn’t be pro-streamer behavior at all.</p><p>“What would I tell my past self about this?”</p><p>Madcat paused, thinking about it for a moment.</p><p>“I’d probably say: ‘This path is hell. Turn back now.’”</p><p>Her heartbreaking comment made the chat roar with laughter.</p><p>It had been a little over a month since that mission started.</p><p>She had played the game here and there before, not a lot, but enough. She just never touched Ranked.</p><p>She assumed Silver would be no big deal and that she’d breeze right through it. She figured it was an easy mission, a free donation.</p><p>Then she learned that there was a bottom even below rock bottom.</p><p>“How many failed promos, you ask? Didn’t I pin it in the public notice? Today is my fourteenth attempt.”</p><p>“…Are you saying this is about skill, not team luck? Well, I admit it. Even so, I have to at least make it to Silver. I bragged about having a pro-gamer brother named Clover. If I don’t make it, he’ll kick me out of the family.”</p><p>The match began while she was venting.</p><p>Her fourteenth Silver promotion series. ‘Please let me finish this mission. Please.’ She sent out a desperate prayer to some unknown deity.</p><p>And then…</p><p>[Defeat!]</p><p>[Promotion Failed!]</p><p>“No! No way! That person must be playing on a second account. This can’t be happening!”</p><p>Madcat grabbed her head and screamed. The chat’s responses varied.</p><p>[Now you’re heading for your 15th attempt, haha]</p><p>[Though the enemy mid-laner was crazy good, no way that’s a Bronze-tier]</p><p>[That was definitely a sniper]</p><p>[Yeah, obviously a sniper]</p><p>[Right, that mid-laner annihilated you. The wall to Silver is high. It hurts, doesn’t it?]</p><p>“Aaaah!”</p><p>She howled again at the results screen.</p><p>Her mid-lane opponent tore through both her and her entire team without mercy. A total disaster.</p><p>PleaseLetMeSilver: 47 / 0 / 5</p><p>TN: Apparently, getting transmigrated as a novel character make you better at playing games lol.</p><p>Yuyu: Yeah, lemme go and read a book now.

I told her I’m streaming, so keep it down.”</p><p>Seo Jaehyeon rubbed his forehead and glanced at the chat.</p><p>Normally, mentioning other streamers was against the rules, but they bent it slightly for Madcat because she was his sister. Any commotion in her stream always spilled over here.</p><p>“Did she lose again?”</p><p>- Yup</p><p>- She got stomped</p><p>“She stayed up late trying to get into promotion matches, and she failed again?”</p><p>- Yup</p><p>- Annihilated</p><p>- Their mid-laner blew the game wide open</p><p>He had told her not to go mid. He wasn’t clueless, either. He was a former pro. He had no idea why she insisted on mid so stubbornly.</p><p>- By the way, that mid-laner was definitely not from that rank</p><p>- The moves and skillshots were insane</p><p>- There’s no way it was a normal local player</p><p>-</p><p>Seo Jaehyeon’s expression sharpened at the mention of a sniper, smurfing, and stomping weaker players. As a streamer and former pro, that raised a lot of red flags.</p><p>Sniping was destructive for any broadcast. The sniper had fun, but the streamer and other viewers got annoyed. Some streamers even covered their queue screens to avoid it.</p><p>Madcat was a new gaming streamer, so it might be a bit more lenient, but as soon as Seo Jaehyeon started his own streams, he was constantly hounded by snipers.</p><p>Smurfing was even worse than sniping in his eyes, especially because he was a former pro-gamer.</p><p>People who kept newcomers out of the game ultimately destroyed it. Even if the player base was huge, it would eventually rot. They forced everyone into the same repetitive environment until it withered and died.</p><p>He was reminded of how furious it made him to see people cackling about crushing lower-skilled players.</p><p>“Guys, did it really look like he&#39;s smurfing? You’re sure it was a second account made for stomping?”</p><p>- Yes</p><p>- Madcat wouldn’t complain like that for no reason</p><p>- Their movement and skillshots were insane, and they had perfect vision control</p><p>- Impossible to be a local</p><p>He wondered what to do. Typically, you were supposed to ignore other streams. However, if someone was sniping, smurfing, and stomping noobs, it was hard to overlook.</p><p>Seo Jaehyeon folded his arms and hesitated, then grabbed his phone.</p><p>“…Yeah, it’s me. Send me an edited replay later. The mid-laner from your Bronze match. My viewers say there’s no way that was a local.”</p><p>- Haha, they’re in the same house but still talking by phone</p><p>- True siblings</p><p>- Couldn’t he just go in person?</p><p>While chatting with his sister, he got the user’s ID and started looking it up on a records site.</p><p>Tap, tap—</p><p>“What’s this…?”</p><p>It was not what he expected. Red lines everywhere, then a few spots of blue, then red again. The KDA was all over the place.</p><p>This ID didn’t look like a quick alt account. Some details didn’t fit if it was a fresh purchase for smurfing.</p><p>From a pro-gamer’s standpoint, it was confusing.</p><p>The match history looked normal enough</p><p>- Maybe nothing special</p><p>The viewers who looked up the ID themselves agreed that nothing about it stood out.</p><p>- Just your average Bronze-Silver record</p><p>- Could be an account someone bought, then used to stomp</p><p>- Would they really buy an account for that?</p><p>Stranger things had happened. Seo Jaehyeon had encountered countless bizarre players when he was a pro.</p><p>He had met players who wanted everyone to lose with them, or who purposely threw after a lead just to see the game reversed. There were also those who deliberately bought low-rank accounts to mess around on. There were more indescribable trolls out there, too many to count.</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>He checked his viewer count, which hovered around seven or eight hundred. He decided it wasn’t worth publicly dissecting the entire replay in front of everyone.</p><p>“Folks, I’ll look at the replay later on my own. After all, it’s a family matter.”</p><p>People wondered why he would do that, but he ignored them and focused back on his stream.</p><p>He did feel a tiny twinge of pity for his sister, who had failed her promotion yet again…</p><p>- Game found!</p><p>…But he was also starting his own promotion match right now.</p><p>- Right, Clover is on a Grandmaster promo tonight</p><p>- Indeed</p><p>- Predicting both siblings fail promos on the same day, haha</p><p>His pro pride was on the line. He couldn’t settle for anything under Grandmaster. He had dropped to Diamond before, and they had teased him for a month by calling him “Dia.” Master was unstable, so Grandmaster was the safe zone.</p><p>When the queue popped, he closed every window, including his record search tab.</p><p>Match History Search: PleaseLetMeSilver</p><p>*</p><p>“Hey, did you watch Madcat’s stream yesterday?”</p><p>“You mean that chaotic Silver promo? I caught it in the VOD. It was wild.”</p><p>“That sniper absolutely crushed her.</p><p>“You sure it was a sniper and not a smurf?”</p><p>“I’m positive. The play was off the charts.”</p><p>Some Academy students nearby chattered with excitement.</p><p>They were talking about a stream. I knew nothing about it. It was apparently someone named Madcat, which I had never heard before, though I had an idea it involved a game.</p><p>“Speaking of which, I did play Ranked last night…”</p><p>It was a first for me. The match felt so smooth that I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>My skillshots, which normally missed, landed almost every single time. My reflexes were faster, and I had absolute clarity on which decisions to make.</p><p>That wasn’t all. Bits and pieces of random game tutorials I had watched on YouTube suddenly came into focus like a map in my mind.</p><p>I knew exactly where to get vision and what to do with it. I began predicting the enemy’s routes, forced them to waste time, or forced them to recall by depleting their health.</p><p>“I’m definitely not that good.”</p><p>I was so locked in that the enemy base crumbled before I realized it. My final scoreboard looked like I had singlehandedly destroyed the match.</p><p>My first guess was the Gatekeeper trait, except this wasn’t happening at the Academy, nor was it for an official exam. I had no clue why it would activate.</p><p>[ Next stop is Academy Station, Academy Station. ]</p><p>And so began another grueling day.</p><p>Even though it was a routine I had repeated countless times, commuting always felt like torture.</p><p>From the moment I opened my eyes in the morning until one minute before I clocked out, it was hell all the way through.</p><p>I even had nightmares last night. I dreamed that as soon as I arrived, Jung Yuhyeon attacked me.</p><p>Except in the dream, he was a regular citizen lodging a complaint, and I was a powerless civil servant. He insulted me and yelled, and I had to stand there politely.</p><p>“Did your parents leave you behind?”</p><p>He threw that low blow again, and I got so mad that I punched him, but suddenly my boss replaced him.</p><p>I got reamed out for a public official using violence against a citizen, for tarnishing the reputation of other civil servants. It went on and on until I finally woke up.</p><p>To make it worse, I woke up twenty minutes before my alarm went on. That dream had been horrifying. I still got chills thinking about it.</p><p>“I hope he doesn’t pick a fight with me the moment I walk in.”</p><p>It wasn’t impossible, which made me anxious. I scanned my surroundings before stepping through the Academy gates. If that jerk were around, I would probably feel his hostility from a mile away.</p><p>“He’s not here.”</p><p>It made sense. A guy who flaunted his superiority wouldn’t want to draw attention to the fact that he got demoted to Bronze. If he did pick another fight, he’d look for somewhere more secluded.</p><p>“Examiner Baek Seojin!”</p><p>At least I had one small piece of good news. Turning around, I saw Kim Suhyeon approaching.</p><p>“You’re here early today.”</p><p>“I just arrived.”</p><p>She walked up quietly and stood beside me, as if she wanted to head in together.</p><p>It felt nice but added a little pressure. Her background, her looks, and even her raw ability were all originally very impressive. Her talents were just stifled by her inferiority.</p><p>Villains had forcibly triggered that potential, making her go down a dark path. I was trying to open it up the right way.</p><p>Activating Third Eye.</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>A Genius consumed by Inferiority</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>All abilities are currently lowered.</p><p>If she fails to escape her sense of inferiority soon, it could cause permanent damage to her powers.</p><p>A flawed awakening may trigger catastrophic consequences.</p><p>◎ Alert</p><p>A Seed has been Planted.</p><p>Seed Type - Wrath.</p><p>Nothing had changed from yesterday, and that only worried me more. I couldn’t figure out what this seed was, or what “fury” meant in this context. My heart felt uneasy.</p><p>“Um, Examiner…”</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>We both spoke at the same time. I asked her to go first, but she quickly shook her head and insisted I speak, so I went ahead.</p><p>“Hey, would you consider taking the Silver exam soon?”</p><p>“…Me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You mean for me to take the exam with you as my proctor?”</p><p>I nodded, and she looked troubled, trailing off mid-sentence.</p><p>“A… I’m… not good enough for that yet, I think…”</p><p>“There’s no set requirement for challenging the exam. Sometimes, you just have to try.”</p><p>“Still…”</p><p>“You won’t know what you’re lacking unless you jump in and see for yourself.”</p><p>You couldn’t take the exam unless you applied. I couldn’t just point at her and say, “You, come test right now.”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo would definitely challenge himself again with frantic determination, but Suhyeon was a different case. If I didn’t push her, she might never take that step.</p><p>“I… can I have a bit more time? I’m sure I’d just embarrass myself…”</p><p>Her voice trembled as she said it, and she looked so uneasy that I felt bad for her.</p><p>“All right. Then how about next week? Let’s try it once next week.”</p><p>“Yes… all right…”</p><p>It made me feel like a villain forcing her into something.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 24</h1><p>After sending Suhyeon off to her class, I headed to the exam area. I waited quietly for any new applicants, but not a single person appeared.</p><p>“This won’t do.”</p><p>There were crowds the day before, yet now it was a ghost town. Some students caught sight of me and immediately fled. I started wondering if Jung Yuhyeon had spread rumors.</p><p>It was still just a “Silver” exam. I admitted I was strict, maybe too strict, but I never held back someone who was truly ready to advance. The second I began testing them, I could sense how lacking they were. My trait told me. If they left now, they would be in real trouble someday.</p><p>They might like having Silver for the time being, but a catastrophe was coming, and many of them would regret skipping proper training.</p><p>“I can’t exactly say, ‘In less than a year, our world will be drowned in chaos.’”</p><p>I briefly considered explaining that my ability was to see the future. That would let me justify why I was so set on strengthening them, as well as how I knew about Suhyeon’s situation.</p><p>It took about two seconds to realize how foolish that was.</p><p>I didn’t actually know enough about the future for it to hold up. I hadn’t finished the novel, so I only had partial knowledge. Suhyeon becoming the Red Witch, looming disasters, a few scumbags in disguise, and some potential deaths. That was it.</p><p>If everyone believed I could read the future, my life would no longer be my own. An ability like that would attract everyone’s attention. Groups, individuals, entire nations would see me as a target.</p><p>It was priceless to see even fragments of the future. I’d become a prize for villains, too.</p><p>I confirmed how powerless I was against the truly strong when I faced Kwak Hyeok, also known as the Elder. The Gatekeeper trait might let me deal with Gold, maybe even Platinum if I pushed it, but Platinum in the Academy was roughly B to A rank out in the real world. Famous heroes and notorious villains were fully trained A-ranks, and the Elder was a former S-rank.</p><p>“I can’t afford to stand out any more than this. I’d be finished.”</p><p>Kwak Hyeok, that Elder, had nearly killed me in just two hits last time. I only survived his third attack because Ma Hakjun stepped in. If he hadn’t retreated at that moment, I’d be gone.</p><p>I had to get stronger to protect myself, and maybe to protect others. Except no one was coming to be tested today.</p><p>“Examiner!”</p><p>At least I got a bit of relief when I heard a booming voice. It was exactly who I expected.</p><p>“Here for your exam again? You’re determined to reach Silver today, right?”</p><p>It was none other than Lee Hyunwoo, the man who overcame any lack of talent with relentless effort.</p><p>“Hey there. Looks like no one else is here.”</p><p>“Not just today. It might stay like this for a while.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“They say the students are avoiding me because I make the Silver exam too difficult.”</p><p>He blinked at me as if he had no idea what I was talking about.</p><p>Someone like Lee Hyunwoo wouldn’t get it. He was someone who believed in hard work, who sweated his way to mastery.</p><p>If it was tough, he thought you should just get stronger until it felt easier. If there was a wall you couldn’t climb, you put in more effort until you overcame it. Giving up didn’t register for him.</p><p>He was truly an extraordinary person, someone who wouldn’t break even under an extreme Gatekeeper test.</p><p>“You must think this is all pretty strange, right?”</p><p>“Yes, I do. Honestly, it makes no sense to me. Failing an exam means you keep training until you can pass. Why would anyone suddenly go looking for an easier test?”</p><p>I felt the same way, but not everyone saw it that way. Some dreaded the idea of staying in Bronze. Others had urgent personal reasons. They’d regret it one day, but it wasn’t my place to force them to test with me.</p><p>“I’ll never do that. I’m going to get my approval from you, Examiner Baek Seojin, and claim my Silver rank.”</p><p>“Lee Hyunwoo.”</p><p>I already had a guess, but I asked him anyway.</p><p>“Why insist on taking the exam from me? You could just go to another instructor and reach Silver with far less trouble.”</p><p>He was only a freshman and had no risk of academic warnings for being Bronze. I wondered if he simply felt safe enough to take a harder path, though I suspected otherwise.</p><p>“I hate half measures. If I’m going to do something, I want to do it properly, get myself in perfect shape, look awesome finishing it, then move to the next stage and do it all again.”</p><p>“It’ll be extremely hard.”</p><p>He agreed with a laugh.</p><p>“You’re right, but if I work that much harder now, won’t it benefit me down the road?”</p><p>He truly was the “hard work genius.” He had some innate talent too, and he added monstrous amounts of effort on top of that.</p><p>No wonder he could climb to Diamond in just one year.</p><p>“I remember they said that was only the second time in Academy history.”</p><p>The first person to do something that absurd was that “crazy blonde,” Irina.</p><p>Unlike Hyunwoo, she didn’t even need a full year. She reached Master by the end of the first semester, then graduated early, after which she destroyed Gates and villains alike as Korea’s strongest superhuman.</p><p>She was an officially recognized overpowered character.</p><p>If Hyunwoo was talent plus effort, Irina was simply born invincible. Still, watching him climb made my plan clearer.</p><p>In the original story, he reached Diamond in a year. I wanted him to go beyond that to Master, which was basically half a step from S rank in the outside world.</p><p>That required two things.</p><p>First, I had to keep him at Bronze as long as possible, stacking his potential. Hyunwoo wouldn’t despair about repeated failure. He would work even harder until he finally broke through.</p><p>That led to the second requirement. As he grew stronger, I had to keep pace so I could challenge him.</p><p>I was fine covering him up to about Gold, maybe Platinum, but after that, I wasn’t so sure.</p><p>He was practically a cheat character with insane growth.</p><p>“Examiner?”</p><p>“Yes? Did you call me?”</p><p>“Aren’t we starting the exam? I’ve been ready for a while.”</p><p>Of course. He could have attacked me when my guard was down, but he politely waited.</p><p>“Ah, sorry. I was lost in thought. You’re all set?”</p><p>“Yes. I look forward to it. By the way, Examiner, there’s nobody else in line today, right? Does that mean I can go for longer this time?”</p><p>I didn’t mind. It just meant he’d suffer more. Then again, that was no problem for this champion of effort.</p><p>“Oh, right, Examiner! Did you hear the news?”</p><p>“What news?”</p><p>“You know there’s a Student Council at the Academy, right?”</p><p>I sure did. I met two of its core members just yesterday. One of them was downright trash.</p><p>“I heard that all their key members were at least Gold, with some Platinum among them. But apparently there was an announcement on the bulletin board this morning that the Vice President got demoted to Bronze.”</p><p>So Kang Hana really did it. She had promised to handle it personally, and she sure did. Demoting someone from Gold to Bronze overnight was impressive. Perhaps Ma Hakjun had also signed off on it, given that he probably knew how awful the Vice President’s behavior was.</p><p>“Why does that concern examiners?”</p><p>“No matter the reason, won’t he try to climb back up fast? He’ll probably destroy the Silver examiners to get himself restored.”</p><p>I smiled inwardly. That wasn’t going to happen. He could never pass if I was the one testing him.</p><p>He was doomed to remain Bronze forever, stuck there until graduation, and maybe even beyond that. He was just that rotten.</p><p>“Let’s stop chatting and begin, shall we?”</p><p>“Yes! Examiner, I’m coming now! Hyaaaah!”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo let out a fierce shout and charged like lightning. I activated my trait at the sight.</p><p>◎ No Pain, No Gain Trait activated</p><p>Target – Lee Hyunwoo</p><p>Stack 1</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 25</h1><p>Just like during yesterday’s exam, I posed the same question to Lee Hyunwoo again.</p><p>I asked what he would do if, as a Weaponry-type, he could no longer wield his sword. I asked if he would crumble just like other Weaponry-types who get knocked around when their weapons are taken away.</p><p>Maybe he hadn’t fully understood it yesterday, but by now, Lee Hyunwoo must have caught on that I was deliberately targeting his sword.</p><p>He isn’t just good at working hard. His combat instincts are remarkable. He can figure out the flow of a battle, along with his opponent’s intentions, all in a single glance. The guy is the main character, so he has talent plus hard work on top of that.</p><p>Now I wondered how this extraordinary student would read my intentions and respond…</p><p>Fwoosh—!</p><p>“Is he out of his mind?”</p><p>I never imagined he would respond this way. When I kept interfering with his sword wielding, he reversed the situation by throwing the sword itself.</p><p>That wasn’t a tiny dagger like the ones Jung Yuhyeon used. One swing of that thing could easily chop off a person’s arms or legs. Having such a weapon flying at you at high speed would scare anyone.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>I barely dodged the sword, and I saw Lee Hyunwoo charging at me. I thought he would aim another body blow, or perhaps go for a strike like last time.</p><p>He suddenly ducked low and drove in even farther before I realized what he was doing.</p><p>“A takedown? Did he decide to grapple instead?”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo was a dual-type in Weaponry and Martial Arts. Most of his fighting style seemed to revolve around strikes, so I assumed he would fight in-fighting or out-fighting.</p><p>TN: Infighting: A close-range boxing style focused on short punches, pressure, and inside positioning.</p><p>Outfighting: A long-range boxing style emphasizing jabs, movement, and distance control. Both are boxing terms. I think MC surprised because Hyunwoo decided to grapple instead.</p><p>“Haaaah!”</p><p>He grabbed my legs and pushed relentlessly.</p><p>If I got taken down, he would mount me for sure.</p><p>My mind briefly went blank. I had no idea how to escape. I couldn’t afford to lose here.</p><p>“No. Don’t panic. I just need a single solution.”</p><p>That realization cleared my head. I needed to figure out one way to break out of this situation.</p><p>“Hup!”</p><p>Right before Lee Hyunwoo could complete the takedown, I launched my body forward.</p><p>It was obvious that he hadn’t practiced grappling for very long. Otherwise, I never could have escaped that. It was a surprising attack I didn’t see coming, but it wasn’t fatally threatening.</p><p>“Ah… it almost worked.”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo bit his lip with a regretful look on his face. Maybe that had been his secret trump card for today’s exam.</p><p>I targeted the weak point of a Weaponry-type, so he turned that idea against me. He didn’t just throw his weapon as an attack; by discarding a crucial piece of gear, he caught me off guard and created an opening.</p><p>He was still lacking in skill, so I managed to react in time. Later on, he would pull it off without leaving a gap.</p><p>“Is that your only trick?”</p><p>“No way. There’s more. You’d better watch yourself, Examiner.”</p><p>I just smiled at his words because I could see through it.</p><p>If he really had more up his sleeve, he wouldn’t be rolling his eyes, trying to figure out how to pick up his sword.</p><p>I showed him there was no chance by stepping on the weapon.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>He realized I had caught on that he was out of moves. Would he just surrender like other students did?</p><p>Or else…</p><p>“Fine, here goes nothing!”</p><p>Yes, that’s exactly what Lee Hyunwoo would do. That’s how a protagonist behaves.</p><p>I could see every move he had in store, so I only had to block them. He lunged forward with great energy, so I slipped past his punch and gave him a light uppercut to the chin. I aimed to subdue him gently, making sure not to hurt him.</p><p>Thunk—</p><p>“Guh.”</p><p>It must have landed pretty cleanly because he staggered and fell over. He was already cutting it close. He truly was something else for a student.</p><p>“Lee Hyunwoo, are you alright?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m fine. I just went a little blank for a second. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>I was reminded of how dangerous uppercuts can be.</p><p>Even hitting him softly was enough to knock him down.</p><p>“Wow, seriously… Examiner, how did you slip out of that takedown?”</p><p>“You tried to fully tackle me at the last moment, so I hurled my body forward. You’re still learning, so there was a gap. I escaped through that.”</p><p>“Right, I guess practicing for one day doesn’t cut it. I guess YouTube videos have their limits…”</p><p>Is this guy nuts? He expected to master a takedown in a single day of practice by just watching YouTube?</p><p>The more jaw-dropping fact was that he almost succeeded.</p><p>At the same level, or even at typical Silver rank, most would have been taken down without any chance to defend. If not for my trait, he might have mounted me.</p><p>“What a monster.”</p><p>He was using a sword a moment ago, then he tossed it aside. He fought with striking, then switched to grappling for a decisive takedown. He could destroy an opponent’s core any time. Realistically, other Awakeners would freak out if they saw a style like that.</p><p>Clap, clap, clap—</p><p>“That was quite impressive. Both of you are really amazing.”</p><p>A sudden voice made Lee Hyunwoo turn and scan the area with a “Huh?” I waved to the newcomer instead of following his lead.</p><p>“Welcome, Kang Hana. Should I call you Student Council President?”</p><p>“Use whatever you’re comfortable with. I don’t mind.”</p><p>She stepped closer and sized up Lee Hyunwoo at a glance. Her gaze was clearly one of assessment, from head to toe.</p><p>“…Excuse me, underclassman, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Huh? Ah, I’m Lee Hyunwoo.”</p><p>“Lee Hyunwoo. Good to meet you. I’m Kang Hana, 3rd year.”</p><p>She extended her hand, and he gave her a wary look before returning the handshake.</p><p>I recalled that in the original story, Kang Hana served as the damage-dealer in Lee Hyunwoo’s party.</p><p>She was an upper-level Mage-type, known for her immense talent in ice magic.</p><p>“That was a very memorable exam you just had. I can’t believe a Weaponry-type would use the sword as misdirection.”</p><p>It must have looked fascinating from her perspective. Usually, Weaponry-types guard their weapons at all costs, but Lee Hyunwoo had turned his sword into a trap, startling me and searching for an opening.</p><p>It was absurd, but also totally fresh.</p><p>“You’re a very promising underclassman. Work even harder. The more people like you, the quicker the monsters disappear, and the more villains we can wipe out.”</p><p>She ended the conversation with Lee Hyunwoo on that note. I could guess what she meant. She was telling him politely to excuse himself so she could talk to me alone.</p><p>Luckily, Lee Hyunwoo wasn’t the oblivious type.</p><p>“Then I’ll get going now, Examiner. I’ll challenge you again tomorrow.”</p><p>That works well for me and for him too. Part of me wanted to say we could do it again right now.</p><p>The Academy’s exam rules only allow one exam per day. That protects both the student and the examiner.</p><p>If I broke that rule, I’d be disciplined, followed by a massive scolding. They’d tell me not to treat government regulations lightly, and ask why I bothered being a civil servant if I was going to break rules like that.</p><p>“You’d better brace yourself, Examiner! I’ll be even tougher tomorrow!”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo yelled as he left toward the main building.</p><p>He was still a Bronze right now, mocked for his single-minded hard work, but he would grow rapidly. Even without my No Pain No Gain Trait, that was his fate.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>Kang Hana cleared her throat to get my attention.</p><p>“You’ve gone through a lot, haven’t you, Examiner? It must be tough dealing with someone like that.”</p><p>“Yeah. I was more surprised today than I was by yesterday’s match.”</p><p>I threw a subtle remark about the Student Council Vice President, Jung Yuhyeon, but she showed no reaction beyond agreeing it was understandable. She clearly held no fondness for him.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I startled you by stopping by so suddenly. I arrived a bit earlier, but you were in the middle of a really intense exam, and I didn’t want to interrupt.”</p><p>After saying that, she cleared her throat again, like she was about to discuss the real reason she came.</p><p>“As you know, I demoted the Vice President, Jung Yuhyeon, to Bronze. I told you I would take care of it.”</p><p>“I heard. I trusted in you, and you lived up to it, President.”</p><p>“Thanks, but I didn’t come here for compliments.”</p><p>She watched me carefully before continuing.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I’m talking about Jung Yuhyeon. I heard that the condition was for him to retake the exam strictly under you. He can’t leave Bronze unless you approve him.”</p><p>“Couldn’t he just ignore that and ask someone else to do the exam?”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“It’s the opposite. He’ll be aiming specifically to test under you, no matter what. He wants to win at all costs and absolutely crush you.”</p><p>“You seem certain.”</p><p>“Yes. We’ve been in the same grade and worked together in the Student Council, but I know he’s not a good person.”</p><p>It was a relief. I worried she might defend him, but the protagonist’s party is usually made up of people who have the right instincts.</p><p>“What do you know about him?”</p><p>“Only that he’s the Vice President, a Weaponry-type, currently Bronze, and in third year.”</p><p>“He’s also the third grandson of the Honorary Chairman of the Jinhan Group.”</p><p>That sounded annoying. He has a powerful backer. Jinhan Group was a decently sized corporate entity.</p><p>“His pride is so extreme that his values have become twisted. It’s basically a superiority complex.”</p><p>It felt like she had a Third Eye of her own, because her reading of his personality was spot on.</p><p>“He got beaten by someone he considered beneath him. He’s going to pay you back somehow. He’ll make certain that you’re the one proctoring him next time so he can tear you apart.”</p><p>“That sounds good to me. I laid down that condition on purpose.”</p><p>“Are you sure you’ll be alright?”</p><p>She asked me cautiously. When I didn’t respond right away, she hurried to add more.</p><p>“Don’t misunderstand. I’m not looking down on you, I’m just…”</p><p>“I know you’re worried, so there’s no need to be so flustered.”</p><p>“A… alright, then. Anyway, even though his personality stinks, he really does have skills. He was complacent in your first fight, or maybe he didn’t take it seriously enough. He’ll be different next time. He’ll get downright vicious.”</p><p>Nothing is more vicious than the Elder, though. I just nodded, signaling she didn’t need to worry.</p><p>“Examiner.”</p><p>She stared at me for a moment, looking strangely curious.</p><p>“You’re not… some special agent, right?”</p><p>I’m just a low-ranking civil servant on temporary dispatch.</p><p>TN: Well, our MC has a stronger backer hahaha.</p>"

When she got there, a student’s exam was in progress.</p><p>It was a Silver exam, the same one she herself had taken right after entering the Academy. It wasn’t difficult. She had enough skill, and the exam itself wasn’t strict.</p><p>At the Academy, Silver is practically the bare minimum. Staying in Bronze for too long results in an academic warning for lack of effort.</p><p>She felt sorry for those students, since it looked like they were being put down for being Bronze. She understood, though, that if you failed to grow, it wasn’t simply a matter of falling behind. Anyone who Awakens but can’t get field experience meets a grim outcome.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo, a first-year Weaponry-type, looked solid in that regard. His potential was visible, so other examiners would have no problem granting him Silver.</p><p>&#39;But examiner Baek Seojin didn’t.&#39;</p><p>She couldn’t figure him out, beginning from his spar with Jung Yuhyeon.</p><p>He said he was not a faculty member but a dispatched civil servant. If he was a Silver-level examiner for the government, the best he could be was around C-rank as a Superhuman. That would normally put him on equal footing with other Silvers.</p><p>“It should be natural for him to be weaker than Jung Yuhyeon. That’s how it’s supposed to work.”</p><p>Yet the results said otherwise. A student clearly good enough for Silver, like Lee Hyunwoo, remained stuck, and a decent Gold-level Awakened like Jung Yuhyeon got dropped to Bronze.</p><p>She did apply some pressure to that process, but she saw the fight. She was certain that if it had continued, Jung Yuhyeon still wouldn’t have won easily. She even had a hunch that he would lose in an even worse way.</p><p>He’s no ordinary fighter. His judgment, his moves, even the look in his eyes. It all belonged to someone who had been in real battles, at least a couple dozen times. She had some experience in real combat too, so she could tell.</p><p>&#39;Come think of it, the other day&#39;</p><p>She remembered what her father, Kang Inbeom—Master of the Tower of Magic Clan—had said a few days ago.</p><p>He felt there was something off about the Elder’s sudden retreat after attacking the students. There were a few minutes when the Elder could have done whatever he wanted, yet the data for those few minutes had vanished without a trace.</p><p>“Officially, they said Director Ma Hakjun held the Elder off. Doesn’t that sound strange? I don’t mean to belittle Director Ma, but that was the Elder. There’s no way he blocked him repeatedly on his own.”</p><p>Kang Hana wished she had been there. The Student Council members were scattered all over, each dealing with their own fights.</p><p>She thought about what Yoo Dasom said, that maybe Baek Seojin was some kind of special agent. It sounded more like reality than a joke now.</p><p>“Plus, a moment ago, I told him about the forces behind Jung Yuhyeon, and it barely even surprised him. He also brushed off the possibility that guy would put everything on the line. A typical Silver examiner wouldn’t do that.”</p><p>Could Baek Seojin have some huge sponsor behind him? It probably wasn’t a major clan like hers, because she would have heard something about him. It was unlikely to be a corporation’s backing, unlike Jung Yuhyeon.</p><p>“Dasom said she doesn’t know him.”</p><p>Yoo Dasom, the Treasurer of the Student Council, was the granddaughter of a major corporate group called ‘Mirae.’ She had far more connections in the business world than Kang Hana did, so if Dasom didn’t know him, it meant he probably wasn’t from that sphere either.</p><p>“That leaves one possibility…”</p><p>She recalled Yoo Dasom’s words that he might be a Superhuman cultivated by the government in secret, operating outside of official channels against monsters or villains. In other words, a special agent.</p><p>That explanation fit every mystery.</p><p>He has no family, yet he doesn’t kneel before powerful backers. He’s officially a Silver examiner, yet he exhibits a higher level of skill. He completely rejects anyone who isn’t up to his standards. He claims he has no real combat experience, but his responses look thoroughly battle-hardened.</p><p>“It makes me so curious! I’m dying to know!”</p><p>Normally, Kang Hana was calm, but once she got interested in something, she couldn’t rest until she uncovered the truth. Yoo Dasom nagged her to fix that habit, but it was impossible to change.</p><p>“I can’t help it if I’m curious.”</p><p>She wondered if she should ask her father to investigate. Mulling that over, she spotted a female student heading toward the main building.</p><p>“Oh, hello, Senior.”</p><p>“Hi, Suhyeon.”</p><p>It was Kim Suhyeon, granddaughter of the late heroic figure Kang Minseong.</p><p>Kang Hana’s father, Kang Inbeom, revered Kang Minseong more than anyone. He was thrilled that they shared the same family name.</p><p>“They actually have different ancestral lines, though.”</p><p>Kang Hana remembered that the two had once met and shared a conversation. This gave her multiple ties to the Kang family, so she got to know Kim Suhyeon through that.</p><p>“Where are you headed?”</p><p>“Um, I have somewhere to go…”</p><p>“You’re on your way to the exam site, right?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“You’re heading in the direction of the exam area.”</p><p>Indeed, Kim Suhyeon was walking toward the same place where Examiner Baek Seojin waited.</p><p>“Are you really going for an exam?”</p><p>“I’m not taking it right now… I’m planning to do it next week…”</p><p>“So you do plan to take it.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon nodded.</p><p>It felt a bit sudden, but also a relief. Kang Hana knew how burdened Suhyeon felt by everyone’s expectations and judgments.</p><p>She was still a new student, but she hadn’t settled in well. That was unfortunate. Paying too much attention to her might pressure her more, so Hana had kept her distance. It felt good to see she was doing better.</p><p>“Hang in there, Suhyeon. Try not to let people’s comments get to you too much.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior.”</p><p>“You can still call me Unni if you want. It’s alright to keep it the way it was.”</p><p>She smiled, and Kim Suhyeon hesitated before nodding in return. She was one of the few who saw Suhyeon simply as she was.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be going, then. Take care, Suhyeon.”</p><p>“You too, Unni. Good luck with Student Council.”</p><p>They exchanged brief farewells, and Kim Suhyeon continued on her way. Kang Hana stared at her back and let out a small “Huh?”</p><p>“Wait. Has Suhyeon ever gone looking for someone before?”</p><p>She couldn’t recall a single time.</p><p>She never took the initiative to ask for help or show her own intentions. She always just followed others because she was exhausted from the enormous expectations forced on her.</p><p>Yet now, she was heading to see someone all on her own. That person happened to be Examiner Baek Seojin, who already seemed suspicious.</p><p>Kang Minseong’s family had close ties to government agencies, even though they never formed their own clan. Her family itself was large enough to be considered a clan. They had deep connections in the political world, the business sector, everywhere.</p><p>So the fact that Kang Minseong’s cherished granddaughter, Kim Suhyeon, was seeking out this possibly mysterious Examiner Baek Seojin…</p><p>“Suhyeon, Kang Minseong, a Great Hero, Baek Seojin, a special agent…”</p><p>Her curiosity, which had begun to settle, suddenly flared up once more.</p><p>*</p><p>In a small bar located in the nightlife district, there were people gathered who were neither Superhumans nor villains, just folks who didn’t fit either category.</p><p>“…So that’s the target, right?”</p><p>“That’s correct.”</p><p>“How do we handle it? Abduction? ‘Surgery?’ Or a set-up?”</p><p>The scarred man’s question caused the man in a suit to click his tongue.</p><p>“He’s still a public official. Doing anything too crude will create headaches.”</p><p>“Then kidnapping is the same thing. An Academy-dispatched official is tricky to handle.”</p><p>“It’s not like there’s no way. Our client only asked that we ruin him socially, so that might be enough.”</p><p>The man in the suit handed something to the scarred man.</p><p>“Take your pick from this list. Pick one and have her make the approach.”</p><p>“Hope they aren’t second-rate amateurs.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. They’re all desperate for money. They’ll do whatever it takes.”</p><p>It was a set of files on a few women, each with personal information. They varied in age and appearance, but they all had one thing in common.</p><p>They were Superhumans who ended up in prison for wrongdoing, and they got expelled from their clans, so they had no means of survival.</p><p>“It’s easy. Twist the situation somehow so those two end up alone together.”</p><p>“Men should fear three things: losing a hand, letting their mouth run, and that other thing.”</p><p>“That other thing?”</p><p>The scarred man pointed at the suited man’s lower body. The suited man grinned and nodded.</p><p>“He’s a public official, so getting involved in any scandal could be fatal. Then we step in with the finishing touches, and the media pounces. ‘Sex offender civil servant’ is a headline that makes them drool.”</p><p>The scarred man picked up the files.</p><p>“So why is that well-off ‘Young Master’ asking for this?”</p><p>“Who knows. Seems he’s rubbed the wrong way by someone again. It’s been quiet for a while.”</p><p>“The Chairman won’t like it if he finds out.”</p><p>“He’ll still side with his grandson in the end. He hates letting ‘ants’ crawl all over him.”</p><p>The scarred man nodded at that.</p><p>“I guess one unlucky civil servant’s about to hit rock bottom.”</p><p>“Nothing we can do. He stepped on the wrong toes.”</p><p>“Baek Seojin… We’ll see a ‘Baek so-and-so Official Commits Suicide’ article soon enough.”</p><p>They were about to wrap up their conversation and stand.</p><p>Thump—</p><p>They were forced right back into their seats.</p><p>“I just heard something really interesting. Wanna repeat that?”</p><p>A golden-haired, blue-eyed “stunning woman” wearing glasses and a tied-back hairstyle smiled at them.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 27</h1><p>Meanwhile, after parting ways with Kang Hana, Kim Suhyeon was unusually angry.</p><p>Most observers would only notice her staring, but she was definitely furious as she stood next to Baek Seojin.</p><p>Her reason was simple…</p><p>“Let’s begin, Examiner Baek Seojin. Silver exam.”</p><p>“You sound confident, Student Jung Yuhyeon.”</p><p>It was Jung Yuhyeon, Student Council Vice President, and the person who had fought Baek Seojin yesterday.</p><p>He was the man who had said horrible things to the Examiner and even hurt him.</p><p>A tiny spark flickered in Kim Suhyeon’s eyes, though neither Baek Seojin nor Jung Yuhyeon noticed it.</p><p>“Don’t underestimate this exam by dwelling on yesterday’s events.”</p><p>“Remembering yesterday makes me even more sure of my chances.”</p><p>“It only turned out that way because the Student Council President got involved.”</p><p>“It only turned out that way because I was trying not to make it worse.”</p><p>He was a public official who had faced countless angry citizens, so Baek Seojin crushed Jung Yuhyeon in verbal sparring.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon bit his lip, realizing he couldn’t win with words. He still believed this guy was beneath him. He just needed to keep his guard up. Even a mouse could bite a cat, so a lion must do its best even when hunting a rabbit.</p><p>“I won’t let what happened yesterday happen again. I’ll destroy you.”</p><p>Soon, your entire life will also be in ruins.</p><p>He smirked inwardly and glanced at Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>“The granddaughter of Kang Minseong.”</p><p>She was a headache for someone like him, at least in terms of background. She could crush him, but she was weaker than even that examiner.</p><p>He couldn’t treat her with contempt because of the enormous figure supporting her, and it pained his pride to bow his head.</p><p>“I don’t know why she’s staring my way…”</p><p>Right now, it was more urgent to stomp this annoying man flat. He needed to avenge yesterday’s humiliation and break free of Bronze in just one day.</p><p>“Let’s start?”</p><p>As soon as Baek Seojin said that, Jung Yuhyeon moved away to create distance. He must have learned from the first-strike advantage yesterday.</p><p>“I felt a bit pressured since it was just a spar yesterday, but this is an exam, so I can relax.”</p><p>Baek Seojin stood in place, acting calm and collected. Yesterday, he had rushed in as soon as the fight started, punching his opponent right in the face. Today, he showed total composure instead.</p><p>Grit—</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon ground his teeth and nearly charged in right then. He wanted to stomp that smug mouth flat under his foot.</p><p>“…Hoo.”</p><p>He exhaled slowly, gathering himself. Being Gold wasn’t just about strong powers.</p><p>“He’s not coming.”</p><p>If he was going to be baited, he would have come charging already. That was worthy of someone who’d been a Gold until yesterday.</p><p>Baek Seojin clicked his tongue inwardly and prepared for real combat. He didn’t pick up a sword or anything else, but a shield.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon, gripping his throwing knife, narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“They said he’s technically a Support-type who specializes in detection and measurement.”</p><p>He had first assumed the Examiner was a Weaponry-type or Martial Arts-type, since his exam fights involved those styles, using swords or martial arts to subdue students.</p><p>That was a misunderstanding. A Support-type could still use a sword or martial arts, though they generally lacked the unique trump cards possessed by pure Weaponry or Martial Arts Superhumans.</p><p>They usually lose if they clash head-on with true Weaponry or Martial Arts users. That’s why most Support-types used shields, preferring to hold out until backup arrived.</p><p>The shield Baek Seojin held looked just big enough to protect his torso. It could block throwing knives, but it wasn’t huge. He must have prepared it after recalling yesterday’s battle.</p><p>“Does he expect me to be trapped if my knife toss gets blocked?”</p><p>If the throw is neutralized, he’d have to move in for close combat, and then this Examiner might try the same quick grab from yesterday. Jung Yuhyeon guessed that was his plan.</p><p>“He’s going to regret bringing that shield.”</p><p>Yesterday’s fight made him realize something.</p><p>This exam wasn’t about using stealth or ambush tactics, which were his real strong points in a real fight against villains. Normally, he’d stay light and hidden, waiting to strike.</p><p>He couldn’t ambush here, and there was no need to force it. If it wouldn’t work, he’d simply discard it.</p><p>Swoosh—!</p><p>Suddenly, Baek Seojin’s expression tensed up.</p><p>These airborne projectiles sounded heavier and sharper than yesterday’s.</p><p>Thud—!</p><p>Thunk—!</p><p>They weren’t the same small knives he usually used. They were bigger and heavier.</p><p>Those wouldn’t be ideal for stealth. They would be a burden to throw or swing around, and they’d also be easier for the target to see coming and block.</p><p>Thud—</p><p>Thunk—</p><p>That was exactly what he aimed for.</p><p>The big, heavy knives slammed into the shield over and over. Its weight kept increasing, which placed growing strain on the wielder.</p><p>It was hard to yank them out because they had sunk in deeply, and it wasn’t as if the target would stand around letting him pry them free.</p><p>“Keep blocking. If you do that two more times, the shield will be too heavy to hold.”</p><p>This wasn’t a stealth move for real life. It was all about bringing down this one foe. He was free to abandon his usual style.</p><p>He spun a blade in his hand and waited. If the Examiner moved the shield away, another knife was ready. Holding it up would soon become unmanageable. Dropping the shield meant throwing away his advantage.</p><p>“How does it feel to be on the receiving end, you lowly bastard?”</p><p>He guessed the Examiner never imagined an ambush-type like him would try this.</p><p>That’s why he wouldn’t ever reach Silver. He focused on the idea that I’d rely on ambush alone, and tried to counter me with a shield, never expecting it would become his own vulnerability.</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon circled around Baek Seojin, who already had over ten knives stuck in his shield. Whenever the Examiner looked like he might lower the shield or touch one of the embedded knives, Jung Yuhyeon feigned another throw, forcing him to burn stamina on nothing.</p><p>“He’s not coming in. He’s just letting time drag on.”</p><p>He stayed alert, watching for any subtle change. After a few minutes, he finally spotted an opening.</p><p>The Examiner’s arm, which was holding the shield, wobbled. Perhaps he had reached his limit. The knives might not be that heavy alone, but a bunch of large ones stuck all over the shield could wear him down.</p><p>He considered whether to charge in right now or not. The man might be faking it, and losing again was not an option. One loss was enough. He intended to wait for the perfect moment to finish him in one blow…</p><p>“Hup!”</p><p>He saw his chance and kicked off the ground. The Examiner had decided he couldn’t hold the shield any longer, so he was lowering it.</p><p>It left him slower to react. Jung Yuhyeon pressed forward without hesitation.</p><p>He would have no time to defend. Moving the shield to his back or dropping it would create a window for me to close in. By the time he tries to protect himself, I’ll already be in striking range…</p><p>Smirk—</p><p>“…Huh.”</p><p>Up close, he saw it clearly: the Examiner was smiling.</p><p>That arm, which had been trembling a second ago, was swinging with incredible force, as if it had never wavered. The shield that looked like it was being put away was…</p><p>Fwoom—!</p><p>…coming straight at him with a terrifying sound.</p><p>“It&#39;s a feint, you asshole.”</p><p>That’s what Baek Seojin must have been thinking as he slammed the shield down on Jung Yuhyeon’s shoulder.</p><p>He had already shattered ribs on his first day here, and it hadn’t caused a huge problem. Accidents happened all the time at the Superhumans’ Academy. It was normal. Out in the field, it would be a lot worse.</p><p>Which meant cracking a shoulder bone was acceptable.</p><p>He still held a grudge for that foul insult about parents.</p><p>Crunch—</p><p>“Graaah!”</p><p>That was all. Jung Yuhyeon clutched his shoulder and sank to his knees. He couldn’t move his arm, and the searing pain nearly made him sob in front of everyone.</p><p>“Student Jung Yuhyeon. Are you alright?”</p><p>Examiner Baek Seojin stepped over, gazing down with fake concern. That look in his eyes was clearly ridicule.</p><p>He realized that his shoulder wasn’t the only thing the Examiner could have hit. His neck or head could have been the target. If this had been real combat, he wouldn’t have escaped with a mere injury.</p><p>“I can escort you to the infirmary if you can’t move.”</p><p>“Don’t bother!”</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon staggered to his feet, gripping his shoulder.</p><p>His anger was about to drive him insane. He had lost once again to that piece of trash. He wanted to draw his knife and slash the Examiner’s throat, but he barely contained himself.</p><p>“The Silver exam is failed. You did not pass, Student Jung Yuhyeon.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Train harder, Bronze.”</p><p>He seemed aware of exactly what was in his mind and rubbed salt in the wound.</p><p>Grit—</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon rushed out of the exam area.</p><p>“Fine, laugh while you can, you bastard. In two days, or maybe tomorrow, your downfall will be sealed.”</p><p>He had gotten word that everything was ready. He had made a special request, and they delivered. The plan focused on “Civil Servant Sexual Assault.” His people and players were standing by, and they’d spring the trap as soon as he confirmed the details.</p><p>That arrogant orphan would soon break down, screaming about how wronged he was, until he collapsed from exhaustion.</p><p>“The world’s not so easy, you orphan bastard.”</p><p>Wearing a bitter smile, he headed to the infirmary, clutching his shoulder.</p><p>*</p><p>And nothing happened.</p><p>Yuyu: Huh?</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 28</h1><p>I suddenly took out a shield for a simple reason. I wanted Jung Yuhyeon to tie himself to it on his own.</p><p>He probably decided this was the best moment, since no other examinees had shown up. He had once bragged about being Gold, but now had to take a Silver exam, which had to be pretty humiliating.</p><p>If I picked up a shield, that made it obvious to him. He was the same guy I had beaten up not so long ago in that spar. He would focus on the fact that I brought out a shield. He would assume I had some hidden motive, and he would try to neutralize it. I lured him into fixating on the shield and wearing himself out mentally.</p><p>He probably thought he had completely thwarted my plan, unaware of my real intention.</p><p>I had seen many like him here and there. People like that shared the same weakness. They mistakenly believed they had everything figured out, when I was actually just waving my tail, telling them to take the bait.</p><p>As a result, he still failed to escape Bronze today. He was supposedly Gold, but I found him underwhelming, even compared to Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>He lacked any sense of urgency. He kept believing he was still above me, so how could he possibly move forward?</p><p>I clicked my tongue and headed back to where I’d been. Kim Suhyeon was watching me with an odd look in her eyes. I was not sure how to describe it. Maybe a bit... something.</p><p>“Suhyeon?”</p><p>“Yes, Examiner.”</p><p>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>I felt uneasy. I had never seen someone’s eyes sparkle quite that much.</p><p>“You were amazing.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“You truly were amazing, Examiner.”</p><p>She was suddenly showering me with compliments. I doubted she meant it in a bad way. She must have been sincere.</p><p>“I realized something. You pulled out the shield so that senior wouldn’t be able to walk away, right?”</p><p>“Huh? Wait, you noticed that?”</p><p>“Yes. It was weird to see you take out a shield, so I thought about it, and that’s the conclusion I arrived at. You made Jung Yuhyeon fixate on the shield so he wouldn’t notice what you were really up to.”</p><p>She figured that out in a single glance. That was no small feat. Then I recalled that her trait was being a genius consumed by inferiority.</p><p>She might have been Bronze and filled with doubts about herself, but that didn’t make her subpar. In fact, her potential was higher than anyone else’s. There was a reason she could have awakened as the Crimson Witch. She just hadn’t blossomed because she was blocking herself with her own insecurities.</p><p>“You managed to make him believe he was still superior, then crushed him afterward.”</p><p>“Right. He probably just realized the truth now, but I had no idea you’d figure it out so fast, Suhyeon. You seem more impressive than me.”</p><p>She waved both hands frantically and said no. She seemed panicky, telling me not to say that as if she truly meant it.</p><p>“Me, more amazing than you, Examiner? I never would have thought of that plan on my own. I only worked it out because I was watching from a distance. If I had been in the fight...”</p><p>“No, Suhyeon. You really are extraordinary.”</p><p>I stepped closer and grabbed both of her shoulders. I wanted to make it completely clear. I wanted her to understand that she was indeed exceptional, that she had her own value, and that she should hold her head up high.</p><p>“Suhyeon. You told me a moment ago that I was amazing.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>She answered without the slightest hesitation. I gave a small smile and carried on.</p><p>“To someone as amazing as I am, you look just as extraordinary.”</p><p>“B-but I…”</p><p>“If you aren’t amazing, that means my judgment is wrong. That means I’m not really amazing either.”</p><p>I said it with a smile, and she gasped, startled. She was so flustered at indirectly denying my worth.</p><p>“Suhyeon. Remember how I told you about my situation?”</p><p>“You did.”</p><p>“Believe in yourself. Don’t bother with other people’s judgments, just look at you. Look only at yourself.”</p><p>She lowered her head.</p><p>I knew it was difficult to do that right away. She had grown up absorbing all sorts of expectations and scrutiny since she was very young. It must have been so hard to shake off that burden.</p><p>I suspected Kang Minseong, her grandfather, must have avoided pressuring her, yet maybe she misread that as him being disappointed. That meant she needed to build her self-esteem even more.</p><p>I wanted her to become a genius who would blossom here, not the Crimson Witch. I wanted her to protect five hundred thousand lives instead of taking them.</p><p>“Nobody shines right from the start. Everyone compares themselves to others and feels small. I was like that, other people were like that, and so are you.”</p><p>Even Lee Hyunwoo was still Bronze for now. Nobody starts off dazzling. Irina, that crazy woman in yellow, might be an exception.</p><p>“Your worth isn’t something that others discover for you. You find it yourself. Don’t say you can’t do it just because you compared yourself to someone else. Compare, accept who you are, then promise yourself that you’ll become like them, slowly and steadily.”</p><p>“…The desire to become like that kind of person.”</p><p>“Yes, Suhyeon. Nothing changes if you keep sitting still. You can rest a moment, but then you have to get back up.</p><p>Let us keep taking these exams, stumbling and failing. If we fail to pass, we won’t give up. We’ll keep trying, surpassing that smaller version of ourselves in the past.”</p><p>I explained it like that and tried to light another spark of determination in her.</p><p>◎ Alert</p><p>A seed has been planted</p><p>Seed – Admiration</p><p>◎ Seed List</p><p>Wrath, Admiration</p><p>…but what on earth does that mean?</p><p>*</p><p>My commute home ended up unpleasant again today.</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s trait gained a new addition. First Fury, now Admiration, which at least sounded more positive. I still had no idea what effect these seeds might have in the future. It was a headache, especially when she had the original setting of “Crimson Witch.” I worried everything would go up in smoke if she fell back into villainy after all the work I put in to save her.</p><p>I felt sorry for her circumstances. She had family who really loved her. I hoped that she, her family, and even the citizens of Seoul would not end up miserable.</p><p>She wasn’t my only concern, though, which was depressing.</p><p>Today’s Silver exams only had two applicants: Lee Hyunwoo and Jung Yuhyeon. I’d had dozens of students just the day before, and now it had all gone quiet. It was disappointing, and it felt like my boss had scolded me in front of everyone. Then again, it was my own doing, so I couldn’t complain.</p><p>“This is looking grim.”</p><p>It worried me, and in the future, it would become a problem for Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon. Not to mention any potential up-and-coming students who might be missing out because of this.</p><p>I thought maybe it would get better if Lee Hyunwoo’s name got bigger soon. If word got around that someone of his caliber kept challenging me, maybe a few students would become curious and drop by.</p><p>“That alone won’t be enough. Who knows how long it would take?”</p><p>I spent the entire walk home trying to think of a perfect fix. I got nowhere.</p><p>&#39;Let me summarize. The students have no reason to come to a difficult Silver examiner like me, who barely passes anyone. Faculty members can do the same job, and they do it more leniently. There was no benefit in seeking me out.&#39;</p><p>So I needed a real incentive for them. They had to feel it was worth tackling something so tough. It wouldn’t be enough to tempt them once. They had to keep returning regularly.</p><p>&#39;Nothing is coming to mind.&#39;</p><p>I considered using my No Pain No Gain trait. The biggest problem was that it required forcibly sticking the student in the Silver exam. They would keep adding ‘stacks,’ but that wasn’t all. I had to approve the student eventually for it to work, and then the Gatekeeper trait might punish me somehow.</p><p>So I decided not to use No Pain No Gain on anyone but Lee Hyunwoo. I would also use it once for Kim Suhyeon next week, but that was the limit.</p><p>“Maybe I should spread rumors about my duel with Jung Yuhyeon?”</p><p>Strong students in the Academy might hear about it and get interested. They might come for a match or even allow themselves to be demoted and then apply again. Some might discover positive outcomes and say it was good training. They might argue that the previous Silver exams were too easy, and that it was better to struggle here since you wouldn’t die. That was just a hopeful scenario. I had no guarantee it would happen, and the odds looked slim. How could I gather a crowd again, when my exam hall was basically empty?</p><p>Tap—</p><p>“Ah, sorry.”</p><p>I realized I’d bumped into someone’s shoulder because I was lost in thought. I apologized quickly, since it was partly my fault for not paying attention.</p><p>“…Found you.”</p><p>Huh? Found who…?</p><p>The third eye activated.</p><p>◎ Hyeon Sujin</p><p>A Shadow Yearning for Revenge</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>Warning – Dangerous Individual</p><p>Warning – Dangerous Individual</p><p>Warning – Dangerous Individual</p><p>When The Third Eye displayed her info, my mind went blank. It was so sudden, and I wasn’t sure if it was even real. I came to my senses only after someone else passed behind me and bumped my shoulder.</p><p>“Oh dear, sorry about that.”</p><p>That person apologized and went on their way, merging into the evening crowd. Everyone else was just going about their normal day. I wasn’t dreaming. My brain finally started working again.</p><p>The woman standing in front of me, Hyeon Sujin, was…</p><p>“An Elder!”</p><p>TL Note: Another Elder encounter???</p>"

I had already confronted a different Elder not long ago. Now this Elder popped up out of nowhere, saying, “Found you.”</p><p>“I’m doomed.”</p><p>I glanced around. Was there anyone who could help me here? Definitely not. This wasn’t the Academy. It was an ordinary street. No Ma Hakjun who had fended off Kwak Hyuk, no Han Jiyoon who had fought an Elder. I was on my own, so I had to figure out how to escape.</p><p>“How, though?”</p><p>My Unique Examiner trait hadn’t activated. Even if it did, I knew I could never beat her. I might manage a few attempts at resistance, like with Kwak Hyuk, but that was all.</p><p>“So you’re the one that gloomy guy said was entertaining, the so-called Examiner.”</p><p>Hyeon Sujin stared at me with chilling eyes. I felt an overwhelming urge to turn and bolt.</p><p>I held back because my instincts warned me that would end in disaster.</p><p>“Don’t bother looking around.”</p><p>She must have noticed me checking the area for help. I sighed, and she said:</p><p>“I’m not here to draw blood, so you can stop worrying about anyone else.”</p><p>That was a strange thing to say. I’d been searching for potential help, not worrying about random people. It was ridiculous to hear that from the one who attacked the Academy recently and killed dozens of innocents.</p><p>She was acting like it was no big deal, saying she didn’t come to spill blood. I wanted to question if she was joking, but:</p><p>“If you don’t pay attention, I can start wrecking the area. You probably don’t want to see bodies rolling around. Let’s stand here a moment and pretend nothing is happening.”</p><p>She seemed to want a conversation, so I decided to go along. If a fight broke out, I’d be finished, and I couldn’t stand the thought of the bystanders getting hurt because of me.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“I have something to ask.”</p><p>She took a step closer. It felt like death was slowly approaching.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Everyone kept asking me something along those lines lately, but I only had one reply.</p><p>“I’m a rank-nine civil servant. I’m also an examiner dispatched to the Academy.”</p><p>She blinked a couple of times, then smirked. Her smile gave off a bad vibe.</p><p>“You have a weird way of saying you don’t want to talk.”</p><p>I moved abruptly to the right. I didn’t know why. My body just moved on its own.</p><p>Seeing that, she eyed me strangely.</p><p>“Hey, you…”</p><p>She paused mid-sentence and snapped her head around, focusing on a spot in the distance. She clicked her tongue.</p><p>“Your senses are annoyingly sharp. That crazy woman is here, obviously.”</p><p>She looked back at me, sounding more urgent than before.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll ask again. Are you going to keep living like this?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Are you planning to keep bowing your head, submitting, and caving in to everything?”</p><p>What in the world was she talking about? She was a villain, and not just any villain but an Elder, standing right in front of me. She wanted to know if I was satisfied with my life? This sounded like a recruitment pitch.</p><p>The Elders might indeed have found me interesting. I had survived a face-off with Kwak Hyuk, so that made sense.</p><p>“I’ll admit that there was a time I wondered if this life was right for me.”</p><p>That part was a bit true. Working as a civil servant had been rough.</p><p>I still remembered the time a citizen filed a complaint because I spoke casually to a four-year-old child. I was supposed to use polite speech even with kids. It was so ridiculous that I sometimes got nervous speaking informally to anyone.</p><p>“You really thought it was wrong? Honestly?”</p><p>Her gaze sharpened. She might have thought I was showing interest in a villain’s lifestyle, that I might join her, or that I might be an entertaining subordinate.</p><p>I would never become a villain. It wasn’t only because I believed in justice. I also knew from the novel’s future that villains were a bad bet. They would lose in the end. Why invest in a stock when you knew it would crash? I had no desire to jump into the river.</p><p>“Still, I realized that wasn’t for me.”</p><p>She could go do her villain thing without me. She would figure out why I refused in about a year.</p><p>She watched me silently, giving off the vibe that she had plenty left to say but was holding back. Her lips even parted for a moment.</p><p>“Next time. We’ll talk next time.”</p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p>That was all. She vanished into thin air as if she had only been a shadow swallowed by light, leaving not the slightest trace behind.</p><p>I stood there, dazed, thinking, “What the heck was that?”</p><p>“Wow. A good-looking guy, but obviously single?”</p><p>I lifted my head to see a woman in a black uniform perched atop a streetlamp. She had an unpredictable vibe and was even stronger than someone like Lee Hyunwoo. She was a powerhouse.</p><p>“Irina?”</p><p>“Yes. That’s me. Tada!”</p><p>She hopped down and strode toward me. She scanned the area and clicked her tongue.</p><p>“Say, did you see a strange woman around here?”</p><p>“A strange woman?”</p><p>“Yes. Creepy, disturbing, less pretty than me, chubbier than me, weaker than me.”</p><p>Irina was an upper-tier S-rank superhuman. She must have sensed Elder Hyeon Sujin’s presence and followed her here. The Elder found me, and Irina found the Elder. I had no idea how to respond.</p><p>Being honest was probably best, but what if Irina had seen me chatting quietly with Hyeon Sujin? She might become suspicious. An Elder-level villain showed up and left peacefully after a chat? People would say, “That guy’s fishy.”</p><p>If you have any ties to a villain, you get investigated right away. Ties to an Elder? You get dragged in for a lot more than a simple interview. All I had done was reject a recruitment offer, yet I could be suspected of being a villain.</p><p>&#39;Nobody in their right mind would just tell her everything.&#39;</p><p>If it had been Han Jiyoon in front of me, I might have confessed. This was Irina, though, and she was known to be as fearsome as any villain. I worried she might grin and say, “So you were hanging out with an Elder, handsome oppa?” and then smash my head.</p><p>I made my decision. I blended truth and lies.</p><p>“A woman? I did bump into someone just a moment ago. She cursed at me when I apologized. That’s it.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes. Hmm... come to think of it, she did have some strange aura about her.”</p><p>I admitted it was possible I had encountered her by chance, with no deeper purpose. A random brush on the street.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Irina tapped her chin, thinking. That made me anxious, but I pretended to stay calm.</p><p>“Handsome oppa.”</p><p>“My name is Baek Seojin.”</p><p>“Sure, Handsome oppa. You do seem to attract weird people. Maybe it’s some main-character pheromone?”</p><p>Hey, if you put it that way, that means you’re one of those ‘weird people’ yourself, doesn’t it?</p><p>“Yesterday, I went undercover in the nightlife district to hunt down some villain underlings.”</p><p>“You must’ve had a rough time.”</p><p>“Thanks. Anyway, while I was there, your name suddenly popped up. Something about setting a trap, framing someone for sexual assault, and ruining them socially.”</p><p>What was that supposed to mean? A trap? Sexual assault? Social ruin?</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Yeah, Handsome oppa. They were talking about you, Baek Seojin.”</p><p>“What in the world…?”</p><p>“I was curious too, so I looked into it. How did I do that? Quickly and effectively. I asked those guys in person. Gave them a little ‘pat,’ and they sang like canaries.”</p><p>Irina demonstrated by lightly clenching her fist.</p><p>“Shake hands with ‘conversation.’ Our ‘conversation’ solves everything quite nicely!”</p><p>…So the villains were right. She really was out of her mind.</p><p>*</p><p>Sss—</p><p>Shadows gathered, then scattered, until they formed a human shape.</p><p>“Hoo.”</p><p>Hyeon Sujin steadied her breathing and dropped down in a random spot.</p><p>She almost ran face-to-face into that crazy blonde. Even she found Irina too troublesome to handle.</p><p>‘I needed more time to talk.’</p><p>Once you headed somewhere, Irina kept an eye on that spot in an almost alarming way. That meant meeting with that man, “Baek Seojin,” again would be very difficult.</p><p>‘He really wasn’t ordinary.’</p><p>When he gave that seemingly evasive answer earlier, she had unconsciously activated her ability. It was a power that crept in without sound or presence, an extremely stealthy shadow.</p><p>Yet Baek Seojin accurately noticed which direction it came from and even began to move away.</p><p>He wasn’t just any random guy. He had survived Kwak Hyuk’s spear after all. Hyeon Sujin had no choice but to concede that he hadn’t made it through by luck.</p><p>‘There’s a real chance he might be connected to that lab.’</p><p>She’d asked if he planned to go on living like that, being tossed aside yet still doing as he was told. He had answered bitterly that there was no other choice.</p><p>“Isn’t that how it is, Sujin? This is why I… we… ended up here.”</p><p>She breathed out in slow gasps, recalling someone who used to smile like that.</p><p>Clench—</p><p>Hyeon Sujin bit her lip so hard that blood trickled down.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 30</h1><p>“So you’re telling me someone tried to ruin me socially?”</p><p>“Can’t say for certain, but that’s probably it. I’d say one hundred percent.”</p><p>Honestly, I couldn’t argue with that either.</p><p>If a civil servant, of all people, was accused of sexual assault? It wouldn’t just end with extreme pressure at work.</p><p>Reporters would jump on it like a pack of wolves, and it would make massive headlines. I even heard they planned to spin it into something beyond harassment—actual sexual violence.</p><p>That’s nothing like a simple drunk driving. It wouldn’t just end my civil-servant career. It would end my entire life. They were trying to destroy me behind the scenes, plain and simple.</p><p>“What a strange big brother you are. Why do you attract all these weirdoes? Are you releasing some kind of protagonist pheromone?”</p><p>The real protagonist is Lee Hyeonwoo, not me. It’s so unfair. Why can’t Elders chase after him? Why can’t you go find him too?</p><p>My skin felt prickly. Hyeon Sujin was one thing, but Irina was even more terrifying. At least she wasn’t a Villain. If she were, the world would probably…</p><p>It would have turned into a place overflowing with mint-chocolate.</p><p>Her vibe was so unpredictable, and her love of mint-chocolate was brutal. The Villains really nailed it with their nickname for her.</p><p>“Handsome oppa, do you have any idea who might be holding a grudge? It seems like you might have more enemies than you think.”</p><p>“I’m not sure. There might be people I hold a grudge against, but I can’t think of anyone who’d hold a grudge against me...”</p><p>Turns out I do have someone. Thinking back on recent events, there’s a good candidate.</p><p>Someone who would totally stoop to that kind of plan. And someone who had the backing to pull it off, so it’s not just a wild guess.</p><p>“From the look on your face, I guess you’ve got someone in mind, huh?”</p><p>“Yes, apparently so.”</p><p>“Who is it? And why are they doing it?”</p><p>“Well, just recently, I demoted a student at the Academy from Gold to Bronze.”</p><p>“Ehh? A, aha! Pwahahahaha!! Ahahahahah!!”</p><p>Irina suddenly burst out laughing and clutched her stomach.</p><p>Her laugh was so loud for someone who claimed to be a bombshell. She sounded like she had lost it, cackling like a lunatic.</p><p>“Irina? Um…”</p><p>“Ahaha! Oh man, that’s so hilarious!! Hyehehe! Demoted to Bronze! Bronze, of all things! Hahahah!!”</p><p>It felt strange hearing her say “so hilarious” so naturally in Korean, even though I knew she was basically Korean on the inside. Yet it sounded so fitting in its own way.</p><p>“Wha—! Ahaha! How on earth did that happen? Hahaha! Gold straight down to Bronze?”</p><p>“He was acting so cocky that I fought him in a spar, with a condition. If he won, I’d do whatever he wanted, but if he lost, he would be demoted from Gold to Bronze.”</p><p>Irina looked like she was about to roll on the ground, howling. She laughed so loudly that passersby glanced over to see what was going on.</p><p>Before long, a small crowd began to form, since Irina hadn’t bothered with any disguise. She even wore the uniform reserved for S-rank Superhumans. Not recognizing her at this point meant you weren’t a citizen here at all.</p><p>“Irina, people are gathering.”</p><p>“Oh, the price of fame. What can you do?”</p><p>I wondered if she also had some sort of Chuunibyou condition. While I thought about it, she started telling people to snap pictures and even struck a pose.</p><p>“Anyway, hearing that makes sense. Wow, from Gold down to Bronze. If it happened to me, I’d want to kill you too.”</p><p>“Is it really that bad?”</p><p>“I graduated from the Academy myself, even if I did so way too quickly. Usually, you never see someone get knocked down a rank unless it’s by their own choice. It wasn’t even Gold to Silver, it was Gold to Bronze. Who wouldn’t feel murderous?”</p><p>Screeech—</p><p>Suddenly, a car pulled up, slamming its brakes. Someone jumped out, running toward us in a hurry.</p><p>“Irina! You have to head to the Association right now! We don’t have time for this!”</p><p>“Don’t nag me. I’ll go when I’m ready. Keep pushing, and maybe I won’t go at all.”</p><p>“B-but then the Association President will kill me!”</p><p>“That’s not so bad. At least you wouldn’t die by my hands.”</p><p>What on earth was going on? She could switch from a seasoned superhuman, to an edgy teen, then back to an unapproachable top-level powerhouse in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Handsome oppa, I’m basically being dragged off to the Association now.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I told you, I had a ‘chat’ with those guys yesterday. I guess I was too intense with them, because they ended up really messed up. Now our Association President is furious.”</p><p>By “messed up,” she likely meant half-dead. I could guess why the President was upset.</p><p>They were nasty, but not quite Villains, so there was no clear justification for a superhuman to step in. Not only did she interfere, but she turned them into a pile of pulp, which must have caused trouble.</p><p>“So I decided to wear this uniform for once. I find it old-fashioned, so I never wear it. But I’m on my way to be scolded, so I thought I might as well. How does it look on me?”</p><p>Irina’s black uniform was only given to S-rank Superhumans. It might appear simple, but the material was anything but. It was crafted from top-tier monster parts.</p><p>I heard it could fend off ordinary weapons or spells without trouble. Which meant an already powerful S-rank Superhuman became even stronger wearing it. Producing such uniforms in bulk to distribute would have been great, but the cost was absurdly high.</p><p>I heard one set cost almost as much as the Academy’s entire annual budget. The Academy was no stranger to lavish spending, but that uniform was on another level.</p><p>That was proof of how vital and precious S-rank Superhumans were.</p><p>Irina, however, saw it as embarrassing, bulky, and uncomfortable. She treated it like a dull black outfit.</p><p>“Irina, please, I’m begging you! Only twenty minutes left!”</p><p>“Ugh, you realize if I run, it’ll take me five minutes? Quit nagging me! Can’t you see I’m talking with this guy?!”</p><p>Maybe I should slip away. The crowd was growing by the second. Soon I’d make headlines not as a sex offender, but as “the civil servant with Irina.”</p><p>Bzzz—</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>I felt something odd, like the ground trembled for an instant, too brief to be sure.</p><p>“What was that? You felt it too? Knew you weren’t ordinary. Are you hiding something?”</p><p>She said that right before whipping off her uniform and tossing it to her aide.</p><p>“Ugh! I-Irina?”</p><p>“Wear that and run. Even if something happens, you won’t die.”</p><p>“Wait, what do you—”</p><p>Rumble—</p><p>Cars that had been driving without trouble stalled, the streetlights and screens went dark, and a ghastly sound rumbled as the world lurched.</p><p>I recognized it from the moment I got pulled into this world.</p><p>“W-what? A Gate?! But we have a suppressor here!”</p><p>“Aren’t you running? If you get swept up, I’m not responsible.”</p><p>Hearing that, her aide threw on the uniform and bolted. That was the right move. A non-superhuman couldn’t do a thing about a Gate or the monsters spilling out.</p><p>Some might ask why we don’t just use guns or missiles, but if it wasn’t an ability-based attack, it was useless.</p><p>That was why “superhuman” was the best job in the world, which in turn let stronger superhumans look down on the weaker ones.</p><p>Rumble—</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>I thought there was still a year to go. Why did we have Gate signs already? I tried to recall if the novel mentioned anything like this, but nothing came to mind. Maybe the story omitted it because the focus was on the Academy.</p><p>Cities had Gate Suppressors installed, that much was obvious.</p><p>Their range might be limited, but the effect was certain, as research proved they reduced Gate formation probability to under three percent.</p><p>It meant Gates almost never showed up in crowded areas.</p><p>“Irina. Has anything like this happened before?”</p><p>“Nope, first time for me. Maybe there’s a power failure at the suppressor?”</p><p>That was definitely possible. The suppressor devoured enormous amounts of electricity. Villains kept it high on their list of targets, though they usually didn’t dare risk it.</p><p>They’d get torn to shreds by the monsters themselves.</p><p>While we spoke, a pitch-black void opened not far away.</p><p>That huge maw was a Gate. Its appearance turned the whole world upside down. It was like the descent of hell for humanity, or a turning point to a new age.</p><p>“Handsome oppa?”</p><p>“How many times do I have to say, I’m Baek Seojin?”</p><p>“What’s wrong with that nickname? Most men love it. Are you secretly a woman?”</p><p>“Let’s drop this.”</p><p>I really might keel over if we talked any longer.</p><p>“Anyway, Seojin. Looks like it’s not just one Gate. That big one seems interesting, and the smaller one looks like an easy appetizer. How about this? I’ll handle the big one, and you take the other.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Yeah. You’re a superhuman, aren’t you? Step up.”</p><p>“Hold on. I’m not field-certified, and I don’t even know the Gate’s rank!”</p><p>Rank exists for a reason among superhumans. Each one fights the matching Gate and monsters.</p><p>If you’re D-rank, you take on D-rank Gates. If you’re A-rank, you fight A-rank Gates. That’s why rank supremacy thrives. Nobody can say much against it.</p><p>“Relax, I’m sure you’ll do fine. You look like you’ve got it in you!”</p><p>“What are you even talking about?! That makes zero sense!”</p><p>Irina didn’t listen. She shot into the sky.</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>“Did she just stomp once and tear the ground up?”</p><p>Was she even the same species as me?</p><p>Sss—</p><p>Meanwhile, the Gate Irina had called an “easy appetizer” fully revealed itself, and monsters were about to spill out any second.</p><p>I wondered if maybe I could actually pull this off. I felt a sliver of hope and tried activating The Third Eye, thinking it might help somehow.</p><p>Not a single trait showed up. Great, I was doomed.</p><p>Happy Reading!</p><p>Please give the novel a rating and a review on Novelupdates.</p><p>It will help the website and also help people find this novel!</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 31</h1><p>One never knew when or where a Gate might open. Citizens who diligently paid their taxes could find themselves in harm’s way at any moment. That was why there were “state superhumans” who worked for the government. Their top priority was public safety.</p><p>People would lose faith in their country’s disaster response if they ever doubted its capabilities, which would make the entire system crumble. The government chose superhumans who had a deep sense of duty, or who possessed exceptional skills. They were dispatched first the moment a Gate appeared.</p><p>Others were affiliated with organizations rather than the government. They registered with the Superhuman Association and received minimal oversight from the state, yet they belonged to a clan that managed them more closely and paid their salary. Those were called “clan-affiliated superhumans.”</p><p>They also followed the fundamental principle of prioritizing public safety, although there was another factor: the clan’s profit.</p><p>When a Gate was cleared and monsters were hunted, rewards were distributed to the superhumans who fought. These were usually precious raw materials taken from monsters.</p><p>Clans filled their storage with those materials, and that was how each superhuman’s standing was determined within the clan. That was why clan-affiliated superhumans threw themselves into battle more desperately than anyone.</p><p>This meant whether they worked for the government or a private clan, superhumans always rushed in whenever a Gate appeared. They also had no choice but to fight with everything they had in any confrontation with monsters.</p><p>Nobody had expected a Gate to form in the suppressor zone. Even though it had appeared, not a single superhuman was visible yet.</p><p>“Where are they all?!”</p><p>Only about three minutes had passed since the Gate emerged.</p><p>Three minutes might have been short, but it felt too long in this crisis. Nobody was around, which made him furious. Shouldn’t they have been on standby? They were worse than any civil servant!</p><p>Baek Seojin dodged a charging monster while cursing them in his mind.</p><p>“Uwooooh—!”</p><p>A mid-sized monster that looked like a giant bull but had four eyes: that was the Orox. They were pouring out of the Gate Irina had called an easy appetizer.</p><p>From her point of view, it was trivial. There was no denying it. The Orox in sight were classified as C-rank monsters. The one leading the herd might only reach B-rank. Even hundreds of them would be no match for Irina, who could wipe them out with a flick of her finger.</p><p>This was a nightmare for regular folks like me. My trait wasn’t activating, so what was I supposed to do here? I hoped she wasn’t toying with those monsters again. This was a living hell.</p><p>Luckily, my desperate plea seemed to reach the heavens. A group of superhumans emerged from a nearby building.</p><p>“Hey, hurry! Keep them from moving any farther!”</p><p>“No one else? Damn it! Hey, don’t use shields! Switch to Plan B!”</p><p>“Everyone, please evacuate! If you can’t leave, go inside a building!”</p><p>There were only four of them. They weren’t overwhelmingly strong like Irina. They seemed like ordinary types.</p><p>Over ten Orox were on the prowl at a glance. Even if these four were also C-rank, it would be a tough battle.</p><p>Irina needed to show up soon. She was probably messing around with more nonsense, like figuring out how to beat monsters in a single hit.</p><p>I remembered hearing that the Association told her to cut it out, but she kept at it anyway. It reminded me that a crazy woman was still a crazy woman. I shook off those thoughts and focused on my own job.</p><p>“Please head that way! Don’t go near the main road or you’ll provoke the monsters!”</p><p>I always gave my best when handed a task. It was one of my core beliefs.</p><p>I got to work evacuating civilians.</p><p>“Hey, you punks! Over here, come on!”</p><p>At the same time, some of the superhumans took their positions and sprang into action.</p><p>“Hey, punks! Over here!”</p><p>“Uwaah! Hyaaa!”</p><p>They raised their voices to keep the monsters from targeting citizens. Animals and monsters alike charged whatever made the most noise.</p><p>The Orox responded, turning and barreling toward them.</p><p>“Damn it, they’re coming!”</p><p>“Don’t panic! Take out the ones in the back first!”</p><p>The Orox stampeded, and the superhumans scattered. It was close, but fortunately no one got trampled yet.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>“Stab it!”</p><p>When the Orox sped past, the superhumans unleashed attacks on the one lagging behind, the one knocking into obstacles and slowing down.</p><p>“Uwoooh—!”</p><p>“Don’t kill it! Maim its legs!”</p><p>It was a decent plan. Orox were most frightening because of their bulk and speed. If they couldn’t charge, their strength was halved.</p><p>“Got it! Next! Get ready for the next one!”</p><p>The one who looked like the leader stared at the Orox’s movements and shouted instructions. They had to pull back from attacking and brace themselves for another stampede.</p><p>“Stop! Stop, I said! Watch out!”</p><p>“Aagh!”</p><p>Someone was knocked aside by an Orox, tumbling onto the asphalt. He must have lost his head after they landed a successful hit on one of them.</p><p>He was badly shaken and couldn’t move well. His teammates called out to him, but he just wobbled there in a daze.</p><p>“Hey, Minho! Park Minho! Pull yourself together, idiot!”</p><p>“Uwoooooh—!”</p><p>The alpha Orox howled and charged him. It looked like it wanted payback for the herd mate that had fallen earlier.</p><p>A fierce desire to crush that man radiated from the beast. The murderous energy it gave off was frightening. It was determined to crush him.</p><p>I couldn’t hold myself back. It might have been a hero complex or something similar, but it didn’t matter. I couldn’t just stand by and watch someone die. That simple reason drove me to leap between the monster and its target.</p><p>I won’t pretend there wasn’t another motive. The fierce will I sensed from that beast made me feel I couldn’t ignore it.</p><p>It was as if I had no choice but to block it.</p><p>– Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>Activation conditions met.</p><p>Trait is now in effect.</p><p>Reassessing the opponent’s rank.</p><p>Rank adjusted – recognized as Silver</p><p>◎ Sole Examiner</p><p>Trait is now in effect</p><p>The subject has not been promoted under Baek Seojin</p><p>Recognizing subject as an examinee</p><p>*</p><p>“Grrrkk—!”</p><p>A Basilisk. An A-rank monster.</p><p>It could injure even A-rank superhumans and sometimes kill B-rank support fighters who intervened. Its hideous looks, hardened scales, and venom-laced fangs were only part of the problem. Even the tail, said to be its weakest point, was potentially lethal.</p><p>There were too many dangers to count. Ordinary superhumans viewed it as a walking disaster.</p><p>“Grrk—! Grrk—!”</p><p>Though that was if the opponent was ordinary.</p><p>“Seriously. I shouldn’t have grabbed it with one hand. I should’ve used just a couple of fingers.”</p><p>Irina sounded unimpressed and swatted down with her hand. The Basilisk’s rocklike body burst apart and scattered in every direction.</p><p>Anyone else would’ve been horrified.</p><p>She had grabbed a Basilisk barehanded. It wasn’t just beaten—it was popped like a balloon. Other superhumans would risk their lives to fight one of the worst monsters around, but she squashed it like an ant and laughed.</p><p>“Ugh. That wasn’t any fun.”</p><p>She brushed off her hands and walked forward.</p><p>The area was already piled high with pieces of adolescent Basilisks. The full-grown ones hadn’t fared any better.</p><p>They all fell to a woman more fearsome than any monster.</p><p>“Hope he’s doing fine.”</p><p>She stretched and took another step.</p><p>Baek Seojin, a low-ranking civil servant. A Silver examiner dispatched to the Academy. That was all she knew about him.</p><p>He also happened to be an orphan.</p><p>“You don’t bring up someone’s parents if you have any conscience.”</p><p>He was fascinating in plenty of other ways. He was weaker than her but survived Elder Kwak Hyuk’s spear attacks twice. He attracted strange companions. She knew he was anything but an average man.</p><p>“I have a feeling he’s going to show me something amazing. A good feeling.”</p><p>That was what she thought as she reached the second Gate.</p><p>“Uwoooh—!”</p><p>A heavy roar echoed as a huge Orox zipped past, letting out a sorrowful cry. She guessed it was the alpha leading the herd.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>There was a sudden gleam in Irina’s eyes.</p><p>She looked ahead. A superhuman was sitting on the ground, and a few more stood there dumbfounded.</p><p>“Worthless.”</p><p>They seemed like the sort who plateaued at C-rank. They probably never put in enough work and blamed their limitations on a lack of talent. Irina couldn’t care less about them.</p><p>“They can’t be the ones who sent that alpha Orox flying.”</p><p>The alpha had a nastier temper and more vicious strength. It wouldn’t let itself be thrown aside without a fight. Its bulk was at least one and a half times more than a normal Orox. That put it in B-rank.</p><p>There was no way a handful of C-rank superhumans had tossed it. Even a B-rank would struggle. Winning was one thing, but tossing it around was another.</p><p>“So that means there’s only one answer: our handsome Seojin?”</p><p>Irina smiled slyly and turned her gaze on Baek Seojin.</p><p>He was too busy helping the fallen superhuman and had no idea Irina was eyeing him like a predator.</p><p>Happy reading!</p><p>If you enjoyed the novel, please leave a rating and review on NovelBin.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 32</h1><p>I managed to help the person who was struck by the Orox get back on his feet.</p><p>Yet he was far heavier than a partially conscious person. I never knew someone could feel this heavy when their body goes limp.</p><p>“Park Minho! You idiot! I told you not to get so worked up!”</p><p>“We need to get him treated quickly. Looks like a fracture.”</p><p>“Thank you. You saved us. Hey, Minho! Snap out of it!”</p><p>His teammates fussed over the unconscious ability user, still reeling from the shock. You might wonder if this was okay. Why were they crowding around him, instead of dealing with the monsters?</p><p>Uuuugh—!</p><p>Uu-uu—</p><p>A moment ago, those Orox creatures charged at us so fiercely. Now they were all huddled together in confusion, not sure what to do. Because of that, we suddenly had some breathing room, and reinforcements would arrive soon.</p><p>Uuuuu—</p><p>“Wow, they were just trying to crush us, but now they’re acting like big, cornered cows.”</p><p>It reminded me that herding creatures easily fell into confusion if they lost their leader. It might resolve itself with time, but not right now.</p><p>“More importantly, I felt my trait activate a moment ago.”</p><p>It hadn’t activated the first time I encountered the monsters. In fact, it had been quiet enough to make me swear I was fucked multiple times.</p><p>Yet now…</p><p>◎ Silver Gatekeeper</p><p>Trait activated.</p><p>◎ Sole Exanminer</p><p>Trait activated</p><p>The opponent has not received a promotion from Baek Seojin.</p><p>Recognized as an examinee.</p><p>My trait was working normally, as if we were in the Academy evaluating students.</p><p>I thought it only activated inside the Academy. Both the Silver Gatekeeper and all the subordinate traits seemed useful only within those walls.</p><p>Yet the Eye of Insight was telling me otherwise. Throwing away that Orox chieftain was living proof.</p><p>“Come to think of it, it was weird in that game too. There’s no way my skill alone could have done that…”</p><p>Uuuu—!</p><p>The Orox creatures were howling in distress. The one I had thrown was trying to stand.</p><p>It shook its head, scanning the surroundings, and its gaze locked onto me. I could almost hear its growl: “You… You’re the one who hit me.”</p><p>Grrrr—!</p><p>It stomped its foot and charged straight at me. When a single person runs at you, it’s already alarming. This beast was the size of a dump truck, rushing toward us.</p><p>A normal response would be terror, wanting to flee, feeling desperation. Yet my immediate thought was, “I can handle this.”</p><p>It was still reeling from the impact. Its speed was fast, but not as fast as before. I was sure I could take it on now.</p><p>I picked up the sword of the superhuman who had been struck.</p><p>After all, the Orox never uses trickery. It’s a monster that attacks in simple patterns. It doesn’t lure bait like an A-rank monster would. It doesn’t wield abilities like a villain might.</p><p>Everything about its speed, physique, and straightforward behavior told me exactly how it would attack, and how I should defend. All of that combined in my head like puzzle pieces, revealing the answer.</p><p>Uwooo—</p><p>Not yet. Not yet. If I move too soon, it will react. Wait. Closer, closer. Until it can’t change direction.</p><p>“Look out! Dodge!”</p><p>Someone’s panicked shout rang out, but I ignored it. If I dodged now, my plan would fail, and I would only be more vulnerable.</p><p>Just a little more. A little more…</p><p>The ground shook, and the beast, once the size of a small car, suddenly loomed as large as a bus. For a second, fear flashed in my mind, urging me to jump aside, but I shoved that useless thought away.</p><p>If this beast could be stopped by my Gatekeeper trait, I had to do it. Otherwise, I would die anyway—or end up ruined. So I had to succeed.</p><p>Finally, it was right in front of my face. That brief instant felt like an eternity. I saw its bloodthirsty eyes, heard its ragged breathing.</p><p>I twisted my body sideways and thrust the sword in with all my might.</p><p>—!!</p><p>My fingertips registered a brief, jarring sensation before it vanished. So this was what it felt like to stab something so soft with a blade. I couldn’t think if it was pleasant or unpleasant.</p><p>All I could think about was whether it worked, whether I had struck the right spot. If I had failed, I would have to fight a furious beast. That fear filled my head.</p><p>Thud—!</p><p>The earth shook beneath a heavy crash.</p><p>Not long ago, that monster had charged as if it would run forever, but now it lay sprawled on the ground. It was completely still, not even breathing.</p><p>I had done it. I saved everyone from the monster, preventing it from reaching them.</p><p>“Hiyah!! So it can be done?!”</p><p>Wait a minute—when did that crazy woman get here?</p><p>“It’s tough just to stab a charging beast in the side, but you got it in one blow, straight to its heart?”</p><p>Then I saw her face as she turned to me. It was Irina, her eyes sparkling as if she were a child eyeing a brand-new model kit.</p><p>“Handsome Seojin Oppa?”</p><p>She suddenly leapt forward, shoving her face close to mine.</p><p>The more I looked at her, the more I shivered. Still, I couldn’t deny she was stunning. I felt crazy for noticing her looks at a time like this.</p><p>“You really can fight. More than I expected.”</p><p>“…Am I supposed to say thank you?”</p><p>“Who knows. It depends.”</p><p>Uu—</p><p>Uuu—</p><p>The other Orox creatures let out anguished sounds at the loss of their leader. Irina’s eyebrow twitched. Then she swung her arm.</p><p>Crash—!!</p><p>“…Insane.”</p><p>No shadow powers like Hyun, no spear like Gwak Hyuk. She just waved her arm, and the monsters exploded in a storm of flesh.</p><p>“Seojin Oppa. You’re certain you have no connection to any Elder?”</p><p>In a way, it made sense she would suspect that.</p><p>She was unbelievably fearsome. Even though it was labeled “a miracle ability,” I never imagined someone could kill a monster just by waving an arm.</p><p>Thankfully, I really had nothing to do with the Elders.   If there was a connection, it was that the two Elders—male and female—both seemed weirdly curious about me.</p><p>“I don’t. You already know that. I’m just an ordinary public servant.”</p><p>“Right. That’s true. You’re just a public servant, after all. Then….”</p><p>Irina paused, a thoughtful look on her face that unnerved me. She was known among villains as “the crazy one.” I had to be careful.</p><p>“Do you want to go out with me?”</p><p>“…Huh?”</p><p>“Date me. Let’s be a couple.”</p><p>She had clearly lost her mind. My common sense told me to run.</p><p>My rational mind screamed that I was dealing with a crazy woman. Yet for a second, I found myself looking at her, hypnotized by her beauty.</p><p>“…Are you insane?”</p><p>My reason told me it was pure nonsense, but my heart skipped. I hated myself for wavering.</p><p>“Ahaha! Just joking! Me, date an older guy? That’s crazy!”</p><p>“….”</p><p>It stung that I let my heart race for even a moment. She was truly insane. Maybe she also had a mood disorder on top of everything else.</p><p>“Look at your face. Seems you were hoping for a moment.”</p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p>“Sure you weren’t? Actually, I prefer younger guys. But suddenly older men look appealing. Seojin Oppa, do you really not want to date me?”</p><p>“Get lost. That won’t fool me again.”</p><p>“For real! You don’t want me, Seojin Oppa?”</p><p>I cursed under my breath, telling her to leave me alone. She was unpredictable, like fireworks that shot up then fizzled out at random.</p><p>It was horrifying to realize that someone this unhinged was an S-rank Superhuman, actually the strongest in Korea.</p><p>At least she wasn’t a villain. If she were, it might have been the end of the world.</p><p>“Ugh, here they come, swarming like flies.”</p><p>Irina’s bright smile vanished in an instant, replaced by an expression of disgust that could rival a demon.</p><p>“Seojin Oppa.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“What are you standing there for? Hurry, grab my hand.”</p><p>She held out her hand, urging me to hurry. I suspected she was about to do something crazy. In that brief moment of uncertainty, I realized her plan.</p><p>“Reporters will be here soon. They can’t pass up a story: a Gate appeared despite the barrier, plus the unstoppable Irina. Then they see me, the top-tier, ultra-beautiful Irina, right on the scene.”</p><p>“…And?”</p><p>“And? This is my goodwill, isn’t it? I’m offering you a chance to warn that creep who tried to accuse you of sexual harassment or assault. Imagine tomorrow’s headlines: a special edition with a photo of you happily shaking my hand.”</p><p>It was basically a free intimidation tactic. The person who schemed to frame me for sexual crimes would see that shot and realize I had powerful backing. They would drop their plan and run for cover.</p><p>“There they are! Over there!”</p><p>“Irina! Ms. Irina! Ms. Irina!!”</p><p>They shouted all sorts of variations of her name, swarming in like a horde of zombies. I finally understood why Irina had groaned in annoyance.</p><p>“…All right. Just keep it vague. Say I’m a capable public servant or something, or don’t say anything at all. Let me handle it.”</p><p>“Sure. If they twist the story, I’ll pay them a visit.”</p><p>Irina’s face turned stony, sending a chill through me. Even I was shocked by how genuinely scary she looked.</p><p>“All right, let’s put on a good show. Handsome, skilled, and single, right? Our Seojin Oppa.”</p><p>“I’m not single.”</p><p>“No? Funny, people who deny it this fast are always single.”</p><p>Irina kept teasing me, but with a bright smile, she gripped my hand.</p><p>“Irina! How did you handle this Gate? They say it appeared despite the barrier!”</p><p>“Did the Association know in advance? Please say something!”</p><p>“Are you sure you arrived here by coincidence? Please share a comment!”</p><p>“Did you and this man eliminate the Gate’s monsters together?”</p><p>Irina ignored their questions. She just kept laughing and shaking my hand. I wanted to at least pretend to smile, but it was painfully awkward. Was it because I was nervous around the media, or because Irina was next to me? I wasn’t sure.</p><p>- External Academy Promotion Achieved.</p><p>- Sub-Trait Acquired.</p><p>◎ Sub-Trait:</p><p>Overtime</p><p>◎ Detail:</p><p>A true public servant is always buried in heavy work.</p><p>If the Gatekeeper condition is satisfied, you may conduct evaluations even outside your assigned location.</p><p>…Oh.

We climbed up again!”</p><p>Staring at the big “Victory” on the screen, Madcat—no, Seo Eunsol—cheered out loud.</p><p>Finally, she was back to promotion matches. Just three more wins to reach Silver. Once she hit Silver, this long, punishing mission would be over.</p><p>Sure, the prize money was nice, but more importantly, she wanted out of this hell. She had hoped to clear it yesterday, but it was a foolish dream.</p><p>Yesterday, right at the climactic final moment of her promotion matches, she got destroyed by an enemy mid-laner who didn’t look like any ordinary player.</p><p>That mid-laner single-handedly carried the game despite her worthless teammates. Seo Eunsol’s team was helpless, forcing her to end her stream out of frustration.</p><p>Seeing her meltdown, her older brother—former pro gamer Seo Jaehyeon—gave her some insight.</p><p>“Hey, I watched your promotion match replay. That opposing mid? Definitely not a local from that rank.”</p><p>“Why am I so sure? Watch how they calculate damage. They intentionally take some hits. They never take the hits that actually matter. They do it on purpose, making you think you can win, then punishing you the moment you overextend. Your rank shouldn’t even see plays like that.”</p><p>He even said the enemy mid might be a smurf, possibly a high Diamond or above.</p><p>He pointed out little details like ward control, skill accuracy, movement predictions, map reading, and exploiting minion damage in early trades. They had never looked like someone from that rank.</p><p>“It might even be a pro messing around on a second account. Be cautious. Their match history is suspicious. Looks like they’re intentionally queuing to align with your promotion time.”</p><p>Seo Jaehyeon normally couldn’t care less about his sister’s endeavors, typical of real-life siblings. But he was serious about this scenario, because both of them were streamers and were wary of malicious snipers.</p><p>“If they wanted attention, they should have just donated on your stream.”</p><p>Sighing, Seo Eunsol grabbed a meal and returned to her seat. She debated streaming again but remembered she’d already posted a rest day notice. She decided to stick to it.</p><p>Plenty of streamers had burned out from not managing rest properly. Seo Eunsol prided herself on pacing her schedule.</p><p>Even her brother, a former pro, hated exercise but forced himself to do it. She also went to the gym to maintain at least minimal fitness.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Scrolling through online news, Seo Eunsol gasped. The headline itself was absurd: a Gate had appeared right where the barrier was supposed to block it.</p><p>A Gate was supposed to be drastically suppressed by the barrier. That invention was the reason society hadn’t collapsed. Yet here was a Gate ignoring it?</p><p>‘Is this just clickbait? No way, even the trashiest journalists wouldn’t go that far…’</p><p>And it wasn’t just one article. Similar headlines were flooding the news. Tilting her head in confusion, Seo Eunsol clicked on one at random.</p><p>“Maybe the suppression device malfunctioned? Or was it a villain’s doing?”</p><p>She found herself muttering aloud without thinking, a habit from streaming. Even though no viewers were there to react, her instinct was to talk as if someone was watching.</p><p>The article itself wasn’t anything special. A Gate had appeared, monsters had emerged, a few people had been injured.</p><p>And, of course, the usual complaints—That response was slow, that society was relying too much on suppression devices, that authorities should have been better prepared. Criticism was always easy when delivered from behind a keyboard.</p><p>‘Ugh, journalists are seriously the worst…’</p><p>Scrolling down, Seo Eunsol’s hand suddenly stopped at one of the photos.</p><p>A blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman. And a man shaking hands with her.</p><p>Every South Korean citizen knew who that Western woman was. S-Rank ability user. The strongest in Korea when it came to raw combat power. The craziest when it came to personality.</p><p>Irina.</p><p>Some even said that thanks to her, South Korea could speak with confidence on the world stage. That was just how overwhelming her power was.</p><p>“The S-Rank ability user, Irina, who was en route to the Association, completely eliminated all the monsters that emerged from the Gate. It was confirmed that one of them was A-Rank, while the others were estimated to be between C and B-Rank…”</p><p>Seo Eunsol kept reading, but her gaze was fixed on the man in the photo.</p><p>Who was he, to be standing beside Irina? More than that, who was this man who had managed to shake hands with her? That same Irina, who even ignored the President, was shaking hands with him?</p><p>“The hero of the day, according to Irina, was another ability user who stepped up to block the monsters. That brave individual is a public servant currently assigned to the Ability Measurement Department—Baek Seojin. He is currently stationed at the Academy.</p><p>And apparently, this wasn’t his first time. During a major villain attack on the Academy not long ago, Baek Seojin had been there as a dispatched worker. He had been injured while helping the students evacuate, even though he wasn’t a security guard.”</p><p>Seo Eunsol found herself thinking, this guy is seriously amazing. If it had been her, she would have just run away without looking back.</p><p>‘That’s probably why he stepped up to fight when the Gate suddenly appeared.’</p><p>She zoomed in on Baek Seojin’s face. The more she looked, the clearer it became—he wasn’t just brave and kind.</p><p>He was also ridiculously handsome.</p><p>For a public servant, he looked like he belonged on a broadcast. Honestly, he would probably do better as a streamer.</p><p>“What a genuinely good person…”</p><p>A guy like that would probably play games with perfect manners. He wouldn’t rage, he wouldn’t cuss people out, he wouldn’t trash-talk bad teammates.</p><p>‘And! He definitely wouldn’t smurf on a second account just to stomp lower ranks like that bastard yesterday!!’</p><p>People like him needed to exist to make the world a better place!</p><p>Seo Eunsol, now a simple citizen, clapped in appreciation for Baek Seojin.</p><p>*</p><p>After stepping off the subway and heading toward the Academy, I spotted something strange up ahead.</p><p>“There! Over there!!”</p><p>“Baek Seojin! Baek Seojin!!”</p><p>“Please, just a quick statement!!”</p><p>What the hell? Was this some kind of zombie apocalypse? A whole horde of people suddenly rushed at me, and my instincts screamed at me to turn and run.</p><p>“Where are you going, Baek Seojin?!”</p><p>“I’m a reporter from ◇◇ Daily! Please, just one comment!”</p><p>“▲▲ Newspaper here! We’d like to ask about yesterday!”</p><p>Did they even care about the person they were trying to interview?! Wasn’t getting permission first supposed to be the basic order of things?! Now I understood why Irina had immediately gotten annoyed when she saw reporters.</p><p>Yesterday, I had done a few interviews and thought that was it. But now, I realized it had only been that easy because all the attention had been on Irina.</p><p>Now that she was gone, they had chosen me as their next target. On top of that, they probably thought I was much easier to deal with than her.</p><p>“Where are you headed, Baek Seojin? How did you meet Irina yesterday?”</p><p>“What’s your ability rank? How did it feel when Irina shook your hand?”</p><p>“Did you and Irina work together to clear the Gate? Please answer us!”</p><p>What the hell were they even talking about? Why were they so obsessed with my handshake with Irina?</p><p>And now that I was actually listening, I realized none of their questions were even about the Gate itself.</p><p>It was all about Irina. Did these guys come from the entertainment section? Wasn’t this supposed to be covered by the social news department?</p><p>“Baek Seojin!”</p><p>“Baek Seojin!!”</p><p>“The people have a right to know! Please answer us!”</p><p>Damn it, so that meant I had no rights?! I had nothing else to say! I had already answered everything yesterday, what more did they want?!</p><p>BOOM—!</p><p>I hadn’t even made it to the Academy gates yet and was too busy dodging reporters.</p><p>Then, all of a sudden, a loud explosion went off right next to me.</p><p>For a second, I thought maybe it was another villain attack. The reporters, too, were startled, letting out shrieks of “Save me!!” and scrambling away.</p><p>“Tsk tsk. Can’t believe they followed you all the way here just for this nonsense.”</p><p>“P-Professor!”</p><p>White hair, elderly features, and perpetually squinting eyes. A perfect combination of all three.</p><p>Standing right next to me, Ma Hakjun had somehow appeared without me even noticing.</p><p>‘Is he a ghost or something?!’</p><p>Seriously, why are all old men in this world so ridiculously overpowered? It’s basically an unwritten rule at this point.</p><p>Normally, superhuman abilities declined after people hit their 30s. The peak of most ability users was in their 20s and early 30s, after which their strength steadily dropped.</p><p>That was why most S-Rank ability users were in their 20s or 30s.</p><p>Of course, there were exceptions—those rare few who managed to maintain their power despite aging. But that usually required insane dedication and sacrifice.</p><p>By those standards, Ma Hakjun was one of the most impressive cases ever recorded.</p><p>Tap. Tap.</p><p>“Let’s go inside. We have some things to talk about.”</p><p>He lightly tapped the ground with his sheathed sword before leading the way.</p><p>The reporters, finally realizing this wasn’t a villain attack, started to regain their courage and inch forward again. But just one glance at Ma Hakjun’s overwhelming presence made them freeze in place. Not a single one dared to take another step.</p><p>“Baek Seojin!”</p><p>Despite the fear, a few reporters still tried to push forward. Whether that was bravery, professionalism, or just sheer shamelessness, I couldn’t tell.</p><p>“I just have one question— GAHH!!”</p><p>The reporter instantly collapsed to the ground under Ma Hakjun’s gaze. He hadn’t said a single word, hadn’t moved a single step. Yet just his eyes were enough to make a non-ability user crumble.</p><p>Incredible. Truly incredible.</p><p>“Regarding what happened yesterday, I’ve been briefed.”</p><p>If it was Ma Hakjun, he wouldn’t be asking about Irina. His priority would be the Gate that appeared inside the suppression zone.</p><p>He would probably want to know if anything about the Gate or the monsters was unusual.</p><p>Was it truly a natural occurrence? Or had someone orchestrated it?</p><p>Then he suddenly said—</p><p>“Who exactly are you?”</p><p>And just like that, my conscience felt a little guilty.</p><p>I mean, I was just a normal Grade 9 public servant. The only thing that had changed was that I had somehow awakened a strange ability. At this rate, I might as well just come clean and say—</p><p>“Actually, I’m a secretly dispatched special agent.”</p><p>That might be easier to explain at this point.</p><p>Yuyu: Bro, are you sure that’s a good idea?</p><p>Then again, maybe after some time we’re going to see that he is actually a special agent.</p><p>TN: Bro from almost getting SA ccandal to getting Relationship scandal with Irina</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 34</h1><p>It was my second time visiting the Headmaster’s Office. I was probably the only dispatch worker who came so frequently.</p><p>“Have a seat.”</p><p>At least I did not crush a student this time.</p><p>Honestly, I treated Jung Yuhyeon similarly, but nothing came of it. He must have been too proud to say anything, so he kept his mouth shut.</p><p>“I heard you went through a lot yesterday.”</p><p>“Ah… not really, Sir. There were other superhumans there, and the monsters were not as overwhelming as I expected….”</p><p>“That is not what I meant.”</p><p>Not that, then. So what was he referring to?</p><p>“You were with that crazy… ahem, ahem. Irina.”</p><p>I could not help but marvel internally. Just how outrageous was that woman for even Ma Hakjun to call her insane?</p><p>“You mean Irina?”</p><p>“Yes, Irina. Until recently, she was a student here. She should have been in her second or third year, normally.”</p><p>“I heard she graduated early because she was absurdly powerful.”</p><p>“It would have been fine if she were only powerful. The trouble was how unpredictable she was.”</p><p>“…Was she really that bad?”</p><p>“I am putting it mildly.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun let out a long sigh. Watching him made me realize all over again just how extraordinary Irina was.</p><p>Villains had their reasons for calling her crazy.</p><p>“Anyway, I want more details about yesterday’s incident.”</p><p>“I will answer honestly, though there is not much I know.”</p><p>“Was it truly a Gate? You are certain no one lured monsters or set them loose alive?”</p><p>Sometimes, villains lure monsters into cities or release ones they have captured. Superhumans are forced to respond, and they inevitably leave gaps in security that villains exploit. They rob somewhere or assassinate someone in that window of time.</p><p>It made sense for Ma Hakjun to be suspicious. The suppression device had worked just fine until now. It greatly reduced the chance of Gates appearing. For a Gate to suddenly form raised valid doubts.</p><p>Yet all that happened yesterday was indeed true. It was a sort of omen. We had passed the opening act and reached the rising action.</p><p>“It was definitely a Gate. I saw it right in front of me.”</p><p>“So it really was a Gate.”</p><p>“Yes, Sir.”</p><p>“They confirmed the suppression device was functioning normally….”</p><p>He mumbled while stroking his chin, so it seemed he had already checked it out thoroughly.</p><p>“If even you say so, it really is a big problem.”</p><p>“By the way, you mentioned Irina….”</p><p>“It is hard to trust that girl’s words. You dealt with her, so you must understand.”</p><p>He was certain that after one encounter, I would know her unhinged behavior. Once again, I grasped that the crazy blonde was even more demented than her reputation suggested.</p><p>“Examiner Baek Seojin.”</p><p>“Yes, Headmaster.”</p><p>“I received a call not long ago. They want to evaluate you for a field position.”</p><p>“Me? I already failed the field exam before.”</p><p>“Failing once does not make it permanently impossible. They say we are facing a severe shortage of superhumans working for the government these days, so they are desperate for new talent.”</p><p>A government-employed superhuman. The same ‘civil servant,’ but the difference was like heaven and earth. The pay, the pension, and social status. All of it was different. Calling it different might be an understatement.</p><p>“That is why I ask if you want to stop being a dispatch worker and return to your department. After a while, you can test again for the field position.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Not bad. It was a good opportunity. It could definitely turn one’s life around.</p><p>If you fail to enter the Academy after awakening an ability, your next option is to become a government superhuman. However, I failed that exam too, so I ended up working in a rank 9 administrative post. Thanks to that, I was stuck with a lowly public servant title, pushed around all over the place.</p><p>Now they wanted me to take the field exam again? That meant I would almost certainly pass, and from there, redefine my place.</p><p>‘Everything sounds great. Except… except it is not that simple.’</p><p>I had to remember. Moments that seem too perfect can be the easiest times to stumble.</p><p>You always have to check where you step. Is there a stone sticking up that you might miss? If you fail to see it and leap in excitement, you will trip and bust your chin open.</p><p>In my case, that stone was none other than the Gatekeeper Trait, my key to turning everything around.</p><p>“To be honest, I am not that excited about it.”</p><p>No matter how many monsters I fought, or how many invisible game enemies I faced, even if I had reached a near-cheating level of Trait manifestation, the Academy was still the best place to grow even stronger. And my wait time was tied directly to the ‘Academy’s internal’ evaluation scenario.</p><p>I had no intention of stopping here. Nor should I. Like Lee Hyunwoo, like Kim Suhyeon, I had to reach further heights.</p><p>Even if I ended up exterminating monsters or battling villains later, for now, the Academy was my field and my Gate.</p><p>In simpler terms, the ‘lane’ where I could grow best was right here in the Academy’s Silver Evaluation Hall.</p><p>“Why not? You look far stronger now compared to before.”</p><p>“I am, but…”</p><p>“If you are really hiding nothing, people may suspect your motives if you stay put despite your abilities.”</p><p>His concern was valid.</p><p>I took the Academy entrance exam and the field exam and failed both. Yet here I was, suddenly strong enough, only to give up without explanation. Anyone would be suspicious and narrow their eyes.</p><p>‘There is no helping it. I have to talk my way through this.’</p><p>Fortunately, I already knew enough about Ma Hakjun’s nature. He was an old man who placed great value on compassion for others.</p><p>He could have lived free of worries like Kang Minseong, yet he had volunteered to take on the headache-inducing position of Academy Headmaster.</p><p>“When I first awakened, I thought the world belonged to me. But over time, I realized how many people like me existed. There are also so many far better than me. If I had not pushed myself so hard, I would not have grown like this.”</p><p>In reality, I just repeated going to work and coming home, never really training or working out, only playing games at home.</p><p>However, since no one could easily uncover that, I decided to embellish a bit. Like a low-level civil servant secretly sweating blood in private training.</p><p>“Then it dawned on me. Perhaps even those without much talent could improve if someone pulled them along at full power. If I could achieve this, maybe people with more potential could too. Even if they seem useless now, they could become great superhumans one day.”</p><p>“…Then would becoming an instructor or at least a staff member be more fitting?”</p><p>“That is fine too. But I am more interested in the ones who, like me, got shoved aside for not having obvious gifts, yet still want to move forward.”</p><p>It seemed like a decent explanation. One of Ma Hakjun’s eyebrows twitched. That reaction always appeared when he got an answer he liked.</p><p>“At first, I took on the Silver rank Examiner job almost by force. But then I realized I had found exactly what I wanted. A position where I could push people harder and pull them closer.”</p><p>“So that is why you evaluated them so harshly. You knew it would never help those students if you took it lightly. It would not inspire any growth at all.”</p><p>Exactly, Headmaster Ma Hakjun. I was beating the drum, and he came in with the cymbals. Nothing could be clearer.</p><p>That gave me the perfect excuse to refuse the field job and remain a dispatch worker. It seemed he believed it to be my sincere truth, because he kept nodding as if in agreement.</p><p>“Normally, I would say taking the field exam is the right path….”</p><p>It was an unwelcome suggestion. If my Trait were to falter, I would be in trouble. It was most reliably activated at the Academy. Even if I left later, I had to maximize my growth here first.</p><p>Eventually, I would have to face major battles and dangerous enemies, but for now, it was like the early laning stage. I needed to develop step by step.</p><p>“If you are so determined, I can help you.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I have many contacts from the old days. A word to them, and it should not be difficult to keep you here as an Examiner.”</p><p>Truly the network of a once-famous hero. This was the Ma Hakjun I had heard about. With his help, I would not have to worry about the field exam coming up again.</p><p>After all, taking that exam was my choice, under my judgment. Even though they needed more government superhumans, they could not force me to comply.</p><p>“If you have nothing more to say, I will return to my station now.”</p><p>Truth be told, there was probably nothing waiting for me but swatting flies. Ma Hakjun merely nodded, motioning that I was free to go.</p><p>“Examiner Baek Seojin.”</p><p>“Yes, Headmaster?”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>His sudden thanks was odd. I silently asked what he was grateful for, and he continued.</p><p>“I heard that yesterday you evacuated citizens and aided your fellow superhumans. It was admirable. This old man can no longer do such things. I am grateful that fine young people like you are getting it done.”</p><p>I nearly burst into laughter right then.</p><p>He used the word “old bones,” literally “old man,” to refer to himself. It was a term for an elder’s body, which made his comment all the more surprising. Could the old man who stopped an Elder’s spear head-on really be that old?</p><p>“Go on, then. Give it your best, just as you promised.”</p><p>If he is on your side, he is the most reassuring old hero out there. At his words, I nodded and exited the Headmaster’s Office.</p><p>“…You heard everything, I assume.”</p><p>After Baek Seojin left, Ma Hakjun slowly parted his lips. Then, from the discreetly hidden phone on his desk, a voice emerged.</p><p>[ He is a peculiar fellow, Senior. ]</p><p>“He is not peculiar. He is remarkable.”</p><p>[ So, you want him to remain here on dispatch? ]</p><p>“Yes. It makes me feel more at ease knowing a young man like him is here.”</p><p>[ Understood. ]</p><p>“Thank you, Association President. This might have been a bit of a stretch.”</p><p>[ Not at all. In fact, I got a similar request. ]</p><p>“A similar request?”</p><p>At Ma Hakjun’s question, the Association President let out a subdued sigh and spoke.</p><p>[ Actually, Senior Kang Minseong also asked me to keep Examiner Baek Seojin at the Academy.]</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 35</h1><p>Suhyeon glanced around nervously once, then continued looking all around.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon.&quot;</p><p>She paused for a moment, then resumed her scanning.</p><p>&quot;Suhyeon?&quot;</p><p>This had been going on for a while. After her lecture ended, she just kept circling around me. I wondered what was wrong. She clearly had some reason for acting this way.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s going on? Say something.&quot;</p><p>Even when I demanded an answer, Kim Suhyeon just kept circling around me multiple times. Her gaze looked so serious that I felt awkward asking anything more.</p><p>&quot;Just a moment, just a little longer... Okay, I&#39;m done now, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>Finally, the circling ended, and Kim Suhyeon approached me. Then she let out a long sigh of relief. Sensing something from that sigh, I asked what had been on my mind.</p><p>&quot;Were you checking to see if I was injured somewhere?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You could have just asked me directly if I was hurt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p><p>After hesitating briefly, Kim Suhyeon carefully parted her lips.</p><p>&quot;Actually, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d tell me the truth, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re such a good person. I thought you&#39;d hide it somehow, so I wouldn&#39;t worry.&quot;</p><p>I almost reflexively denied her words. But thinking about it, I found it slightly difficult to argue against what she said.</p><p>If I had actually been injured, would I have told Kim Suhyeon honestly? Probably not. It would have been uncomfortable to see her worrying. Especially when she needed to focus on her promotion exam, I wouldn&#39;t want her distracted.</p><p>&quot;I won&#39;t hide it next time. Is that okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you promising?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I promise. In return, you&#39;ll trust me and follow along, right?&quot;</p><p>Unlike Lee Hyunwoo, who was growing well on his own, Kim Suhyeon required careful attention.</p><p>Just a slight dent in her confidence, and she&#39;d be asking to postpone her Silver exam. That wouldn&#39;t be good. Delaying further wouldn&#39;t benefit either of us.</p><p>Above all, to eliminate her inferiority complex, she needed certainty.</p><p>The feeling that she was improving, that she was being recognized. To give her that feeling, the promotion exam had to begin without fail.</p><p>But forcing her wouldn&#39;t work either. I needed to persuade her, guide her, and make her approach on her own.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t ignore that Kim Suhyeon&#39;s original future was as the &#39;Crimson Witch.&#39;</p><p>Even if that wasn&#39;t the case now. Even if she hadn&#39;t been captured and brainwashed by villains. I had to consider the possibility that she might somehow follow the original flow. Especially since one of those &quot;seeds&quot; was still labeled as &quot;wrath&quot;—that was particularly concerning!</p><p>&quot;Is it over now? Can we start?&quot;</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo, who had been waiting quietly until now, stood up abruptly. Kim Suhyeon wasn&#39;t the only one here. He was with us too.</p><p>I had noticed earlier that the two of them came together, which was a strange sight. Originally, they were supposed to be mortal enemies, with him fighting the Crimson Witch. Now they were laughing together as &quot;Bronze comrades!&quot;</p><p>For a moment, I wondered if they might be dating. But I immediately scolded myself for such a ridiculous thought.</p><p>Like many protagonists in novels, our protagonist Lee Hyunwoo had a screw loose. Not that he was crazy like Irina. His issue was with how he dealt with the opposite sex. In crude terms, he was practically emotionally stunted when it came to romance.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me. Do we really, really have to do the exam today?&quot;</p><p>Even with Kim Suhyeon giving him a sharp look, Lee Hyunwoo was looking at me with an expression that seemed to say, &quot;So what?&quot;</p><p>Other male students might&#39;ve picked up on the atmosphere, but not Lee Hyunwoo. He only showed his eagerness to take the exam right away.</p><p>&quot;The examiner must be tired from yesterday&#39;s events...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine, Suhyeon. It won&#39;t take long anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow. Examiner, that&#39;s a bit much. I&#39;ve been training hard every day, you know.&quot;</p><p>I was aware of that. I knew, but it still felt like he had a long way to go.</p><p>Compared to Irina or Elder, and even the pressure I felt from Ma Hakjun, Lee Hyunwoo didn&#39;t exude that same intimidating aura. If he had grown even a little more, there might have been a slight tingle of that feeling. But not yet. That meant he was still Bronze.</p><p>&quot;Thank you for your support today, Examiner!&quot;</p><p>While he said that, his expression looked like he wanted to punch me right away. I couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the absurdity as Lee Hyunwoo charged at me.</p><p>*</p><p>Thud―!</p><p>&quot;Ugh!&quot;</p><p>The pressure was accurate. There wasn&#39;t much change from yesterday. Lee Hyunwoo was sprawled on the ground, gasping for breath. It was a rather pitiful sight for a protagonist, but it would all pay off in the end.</p><p>◎ No Pain, No Gain</p><p>Trait activated.</p><p>Target – Lee Hyunwoo</p><p>Stacks 3</p><p>The three stacks accumulated from the recent exam would eventually turn into something significant.</p><p>However, I couldn&#39;t predict how powerful it would become when Lee Hyunwoo grew stronger than he was now.</p><p>In a fleeting moment of judgment and movement, the outcome—no, the very essence of life and death—could hinge on it. It would increase the likelihood of Lee Hyunwoo emerging as the final victor, not against monsters or villains, but in his own right.</p><p>Thinking about it, the name of the trait suited him perfectly.</p><p>&quot;Wow, this is just... unbelievable.&quot;</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo, who had barely managed to sit up, blinked in disbelief.</p><p>&quot;Examiner, you&#39;re a support type, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right, support type.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then how come your martial arts and weapon handling skills are so good? That&#39;s not typical for a support type.&quot;</p><p>I flinched slightly at Lee Hyunwoo&#39;s question.</p><p>Honestly, I thought it was a bit precarious.</p><p>Fortunately, I had discussed this with Ma Hakjun and established a concept.</p><p>A public servant of the support type who trained hard without giving up.</p><p>After all, unlike true weapon or martial arts types, I didn&#39;t have any ultimate abilities that relied on powers. And with enough effort, anyone could master weapons or martial arts.</p><p>Focusing on one area was indeed more powerful and easier to gain recognition.</p><p>&quot;I worked hard, just like you, Lee Hyunwoo. You’re a weapon type, but you also use martial arts, right? Just like a martial arts type.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I&#39;m not as skilled as you, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ll get there soon. After all, hard work is the best talent.&quot;</p><p>At least for Lee Hyunwoo, that was true. He was someone who would grow with effort. He was the quintessential protagonist buff recipient.</p><p>Hearing my words, Lee Hyunwoo grinned and jumped to his feet.</p><p>&quot;You really know what you&#39;re talking about, Examiner! That&#39;s right. Hard work is true talent.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s just you. You&#39;re the only one who climbs steadily with effort.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll challenge you again tomorrow. I’ll make it for sure!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you saying you’ll promote? Are you confident?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Um, not tomorrow, but the next time.&quot;</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo said that and turned to dash off.</p><p>He would probably head straight to the training ground and start swinging his sword. Outside of class, he practiced daily, honing his body and building his patience. With that level of effort, it would be strange if he didn&#39;t grow.</p><p>&#39;But is this really the end of the exam today? This is a big deal.&#39;</p><p>As a Silver Gatekeeper, it was a problem that no one was challenging me. I even found myself wishing that Jung yuhyeon would show up. If I didn&#39;t find a way, my growth would completely stagnate...</p><p>&quot;Ex-Examiner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, I think someone is coming.&quot;</p><p>Even as Kim Suhyeon shot me a sharp look, I turned my head toward the entrance. Indeed, several students were approaching the examination room.</p><p>I hoped they weren&#39;t lost like last time. Or worse, I hoped they wouldn&#39;t come and run away upon seeing me.</p><p>&quot;Um, are you the Examiner Baek Seojin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s me. If you’re lost, please turn back quickly...&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, we came here correctly. We... came to take the exam.&quot;</p><p>Did I just hear that correctly? They said they came to take the exam?</p><p>Looking back at Kim Suhyeon, she was clapping her hands softly. It seemed to be a congratulatory gesture, indicating that I hadn&#39;t misheard them.</p><p>&quot;Just a moment.&quot;</p><p>I scanned the students who had arrived. I could see the reason behind their presence.</p><p>Among the group, a pair of boys and girls seemed to have come for similar reasons as reporters. They likely thought I had some connection to the famous S-rank ability user after seeing yesterday&#39;s article.</p><p>&#39;As expected, not everyone comes with good intentions.&#39;</p><p>However, one of them stood out. This student seemed different from the others, likely drawn by the recent gate incident where I had played a significant role.</p><p>&quot;Then, all three of you are Bronze, correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then we&#39;ll proceed with the exam in order.&quot;</p><p>I decided to filter out the two who seemed to be there for the wrong reasons and focus on the one who appeared genuinely interested in improving. If they were a decent candidate, I could pair them with Lee Hyunwoo and encourage them to grow together.</p><p>&quot;Alright, let&#39;s begin...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, Examiner!&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon, who had been quietly observing, pointed toward the entrance again.</p><p>&quot;What now?&quot;</p><p>This time, more students were entering the examination room.</p><p>&quot;Is this the right place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, it is. I&#39;m Baek Seojin, the examiner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, I saw the article yesterday. You really are impressive!&quot;</p><p>I could sense the mixed intentions among the students. Some were genuinely eager to learn, while others were likely hoping to ride the coattails of my newfound recognition.</p><p>&quot;Thank you for coming. Please line up if you&#39;re here for the exam.&quot;</p><p>As they gathered, I noticed that not all of them were there for the right reasons. Some were clearly there to gauge my abilities or to see if they could gain something from my reputation.</p><p>&quot;Well, I suppose I should help them as best as I can. After all, their efforts today might save them from greater struggles in the future.&quot;</p><p>Despite the challenges ahead, I was determined to guide them through their trials, hoping that the sweat they shed today would spare them from bloodshed later on.</p><p>In the end, I had my own goals to achieve as well.</p>"

With that, the Silver exams for the students who had just gathered were officially concluded.</p><p>None of them measured up to Lee Hyunwoo. It would be an insult to even call them a lesser version of him. I had expected this, but seeing it with my own eyes and experiencing it firsthand made the reality hit even harder.</p><p>If I had to point out any positives, two of them showed some potential.</p><p>They weren’t here just because they appeared in the newspaper or had connections with Irina. They were genuinely skilled students who wanted to improve, and they were facing a judge who wouldn’t go easy on them.</p><p>They were students who wanted to break through their limits and truly advance.</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work. Unfortunately, it seems you’ve failed this promotion exam.”</p><p>“…Yes, it seems so.”</p><p>“Don’t be too discouraged. If you keep trying, you can definitely improve. I hope to see you again next time.”</p><p>I meant every word. This student had a genuine desire to improve. I hope these kinds of students don’t succumb to reality and take the easy path. Someday, that decision could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p>“Good job.”</p><p>The Bronze-ranked student straightens up and leaves the examination room.</p><p>There’s nothing I can do if they go to another examiner. I can’t stop them. No, I can’t even if I wanted to.</p><p>If the immediate reality is a problem, then it’s an unavoidable choice.</p><p>Moreover, to the students, I, the Silver Gatekeeper, must seem like the worst of the worst.</p><p>I could ease up a bit, but there are Gold promotion exams and even higher-level assessments to consider. If they remain stuck at Bronze without moving up to Silver, they risk academic probation.</p><p>It’s no wonder they’re struggling with the promotion to Silver.</p><p>‘Honestly, if someone asked me that, I’d feel pretty guilty.’</p><p>There are certainly reasons for blocking Silver promotions that benefit me. I won’t deny that. I need to survive. It’s my only powerful weapon.</p><p>But I didn’t take that as my sole purpose or reason. I want the students who can’t seem to get past this point to grow stronger.</p><p>Being mocked for being Bronze, being looked down upon for being Silver. But when it comes to the actual competition, they end up losing to those Bronze and Silver students. If that raises the overall level of the academy students, then that’s a good thing.</p><p>Even if it’s a forced justification for my own sake, so be it.</p><p>Soon, a great catastrophe will begin, and whether they are veterans or newcomers, they will be thrown into the fray and weeded out.</p><p>In that process, I hope at least one of those students survives. This is not a mere excuse.</p><p>Honey, don’t let your heart weaken. Since you’ve taken on the role of a Gatekeeper, be more ruthless. This is for me and for them, so have confidence.</p><p>“Still, not bad at all.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>Maybe I said that a bit too loudly. Kim Suhyeon responds, thinking I was talking to her.</p><p>“I wasn’t talking to you, Suhyeon. I was referring to the student from earlier and the one before that.”</p><p>“Oh….”</p><p>“They really put in the effort. I felt a bit guilty for them.”</p><p>In the end, those who work hard must be defeated. Those who strive to surpass must be held back.</p><p>Both for me and for them, rewards for growth await. But it’s bittersweet. It’s not a pleasant situation.</p><p>“Examiner Baek Seojin.”</p><p>After a brief silence, Kim Suhyeon suddenly raises her hand, as if she’s in school and shouting, “Me!”</p><p>“I want to take the promotion exam now.”</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>“Yes. I want to take the exam too.”</p><p>It’s unexpected, but not a bad idea. It’s better for Kim Suhyeon to do it as soon as possible. The exam can only be taken once a day, and the trait “No Pain, No Gain” can also be activated once a day. Every day that passes is a loss. So, doing it right away is beneficial.</p><p>“Shall we start the exam right away? There’s less than 30 minutes left in the lecture.”</p><p>Nodding at my words, Kim Suhyeon stands on the opposite side of me.</p><p>◎ No Pain, No Gain</p><p>Trait activated.</p><p>Target – Kim Suhyeon</p><p>I immediately activate the trait and observe Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>‘Surprisingly… her stance is good?’</p><p>Kim Suhyeon is a weaponry type. I expected her to take a clumsy stance. But now that I see her, her stance is already above average.</p><p>There are no noticeable gaps.</p><p>Sure, if someone forced their way in, there might be openings , but up until now, she appears flawless.</p><p>The issue is that the exam isn’t just about stance.</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Suhyeon?”</p><p>She stood frozen, not doing anything.</p><p>This is an exam. It’s her chance to showcase her skills to the fullest. Yet, Kim Suhyeon is overly focused on my movements, clearly tense.</p><p>I wonder if she’s a defensive type, so I decide to test her by making an initial attack.</p><p>Thwack—</p><p>The sword in Kim Suhyeon’s hand is knocked out of her grip and embeds itself into the ground. She stops and stares at me, unsure of what to do next.</p><p>“I-I’m sorry, Examiner! I’ll try again!”</p><p>But the second chance yields the same result. She barely manages to swing her sword before losing it again.</p><p>Is she lacking strength? No, that’s not the issue. The real problem is that she lacks confidence in her own abilities.</p><p>Her sword was clearly ready to defend against my attack. She anticipated where I would strike and when.</p><p>Yet, she hesitates in that crucial moment, unable to trust herself. That hesitation turns into a freeze, preventing her from executing her moves properly.</p><p>At this rate, she won’t be able to pass the exam.</p><p>It’s not that she lacks the skill to perform; it’s just that she doesn’t believe in herself enough. I never expected her to have such a lack of confidence.</p><p>‘What should I do?’</p><p>I watch Kim Suhyeon, who looks more defeated than when we started, and I ponder how to draw out her true abilities.</p><p>Encouragement? That won’t work. I can’t keep cheering her on indefinitely. After all, an exam is a battle in itself. You can’t win a fight with just encouragement.</p><p>The foundation of combat lies in having a sense of enmity and anger towards your opponent. It’s about instilling the will to win.</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>So, I decided to try a different approach.</p><p>“Can you tell me when was the last time you were really angry?”</p><p>“Angry…?”</p><p>“Yeah. A time when you were really furious.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon pauses, contemplating, before cautiously speaking.</p><p>“Jung Yuhyeon….”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“When you got hurt because of Jung Yuhyeon.”</p><p>It seems I asked a foolish question.</p><p>Thinking back to when the seed of anger was planted, the answer becomes clear.</p><p>“Well, Suhyeon, let’s do this… imagine I’m Jung Yuhyeon right now.”</p><p>“You? How can you be Jung Yuhyeon? You’re my examiner!”</p><p>She shakes her head vehemently, as if the idea is absurd. It’s the first time I’ve seen her react so dramatically. This gives me confidence that my approach might work.</p><p>“Okay, Suhyeon. Close your eyes and think back to that day. The day when my clothes were soaked in blood.”</p><p>“Blood….”</p><p>“That day, Jung Yuhyeon’s dagger grazed my side. If it had been just a bit deeper, I could have suffered serious internal injuries. If that had happened, it wouldn’t have ended with just a little blood.”</p><p>I apologized to Jung Yuhyeon in my mind. Since we’re not on good terms anyway, I might as well use him.</p><p>“And you said he told me that I just a filthy orphan.”</p><p>Honestly, I hesitated to say that last part. I must have thought about it ten times before deciding to go through with it.</p><p>Clang—</p><p>I can see that my strategy is working as Kim Suhyeon’s sword comes flying toward me.</p><p>‘But….’</p><p>But why are her eyes turning so red?</p><p>“Jung Yuhyeon.”</p><p>In that moment, I wondered if I should just stop this.</p><p>Is this really the same Kim Suhyeon who hesitated to attack just moments ago? Now, she’s launching furious strikes at me, filled with rage.</p><p>Swish— Boom—!</p><p>This is insane. Is this really the same Kim Suhyeon who couldn’t even defend herself a moment ago? Now she’s swinging her sword as if daring me to try and block it?!</p><p>Her eyes are bloodshot, and it’s clear she’s genuinely angry. But amidst that fury, her attacks are precise and fluid.</p><p>She’s launching slashing attacks from the front, only to suddenly switch to thrusts. The strikes are sharp and deadly, executed with a grace that’s almost mesmerizing. I remember Lee Hyunwoo couldn’t even manage this level of attack transition.</p><p>I can see why the villains targeted Kim Suhyeon. Just a flicker of anger has unleashed this level of power, and if she were brainwashed, she would be even more formidable.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>I barely manage to dodge her attack, but she follows up with a strike that catches me off guard.</p><p>If I had taken that hit directly, I might have been seriously injured.</p><p>Each attack is lethal, aimed at critical points—chest, neck, abdomen, and face. Kim Suhyeon’s blade is precisely targeting all the vital areas.</p><p>This feels like fighting a completely different person.</p><p>It’s Kim Suhyeon wielding the sword, but it doesn’t feel like her at all.</p><p>‘She’s skilled. Yes, it’s threatening, but….’</p><p>As time passes, I notice Kim Suhyeon’s breathing becoming more labored. It’s impossible for her to maintain such a high tempo without tiring out.</p><p>“Hah, hah….”</p><p>Just in time, the red glint in her eyes begins to fade.</p><p>‘This is the end of the exam.’</p><p>Her swordsmanship is on par with Lee Hyunwoo’s, but she lacks the stamina to support it. She also needs time to regain control of her mind before entering a battle.</p><p>Thus, the result is, unsurprisingly, a failure in promotion.</p><p>“Ow!”</p><p>Before Kim Suhyeon can catch her breath, I close the distance and lightly tap her on the head. She stumbles back, staring at me in shock.</p><p>“Good job, Suhyeon.”</p><p>“Examiner….”</p><p>“Unfortunately, you’ve failed the promotion today. Your attacks were great, but you exhausted yourself too quickly.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon doesn’t respond. She simply looks at me, and then suddenly stands up straight.</p><p>“I’m so sorry! Examiner! I’m really sorry!!”</p><p>“Huh? No, you did well! Why are you apologizing?” “</p><p>I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to get so angry!”</p><p>It seems that she’s really troubled by how fiercely she attacked me.</p><p>I can’t help but feel a sense of anticipation. There’s a low chance of any significant change, but I still want to check.</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye.</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>A genius consumed by inferiority.</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>All abilities are temporarily reduced. Prolonged inferiority could result in permanent power loss. Improper development could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p>◎ Seed List</p><p>Wrath, Admiration.</p><p>Yes, as expected, aside from that seed, there’s no other change.</p><p>◎ Notification</p><p>Future traits may change.</p><p>Finally, it has appeared.</p><p>Yuyu: Yay!

After that, each student had free time to spend as they wished.</p><p>They could rest. They could build relationships with someone. If they felt painfully aware of their own shortcomings, they might devote themselves to extra training. The choice was theirs, and so were the consequences.</p><p>“Whew, whew!”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo had been running for more than thirty minutes in the empty training hall where no one else was present. He was drenched in sweat and panting hard, though he never stopped. Others would have quit in disgust, but Lee Hyunwoo kept running.</p><p>He was convinced that he had no noticeable talent. He believed that his only real strength was his persistence.</p><p>That was why he pushed himself to the limits with that persistence.</p><p>When others practiced ten times, he practiced a hundred. If others practiced a hundred times, he practiced ten thousand.</p><p>He had no talent, so he worked harder. He believed that if he worked hard, at least he could become someone’s equal. Relying on that belief, Lee Hyunwoo never once took a break and kept driving himself onward.</p><p>Beep—</p><p>His alarm beeped, telling him that he had finished his target distance. Only then, did Lee Hyunwoo slow his pace and come to a stop.</p><p>“Alright. Now I’ll swing the sword a hundred times.”</p><p>Others would have tried to take at least a quick breather. He decided otherwise and gripped his sword, taking his stance.</p><p>He had heard that battles with monsters and villains were never so leisurely. He had heard that there would be no chance to catch one’s breath on a battlefield where life and death intermixed.</p><p>Professors always stressed that everything at the Academy was different from “the real field.” Here, if you got tired, you could pause for a moment, or if you were hurt, you could receive treatment right away. They said once you left this place, you would realize that was an unimaginable luxury.</p><p>No one wanted to die a ridiculous death, so you had to become stronger. No one wanted to be a burden, so you had to become stronger. Even if you only wanted fame, you still had to be strong.</p><p>If someone could rely on talent to become strong, that was fine. In Lee Hyunwoo’s case, the only path to strength was through effort.</p><p>Swish, swish!</p><p>His body was exhausted from such extreme training, yet Lee Hyunwoo held firm. His eyes were still alive, and his sword traveled the path he intended it to take.</p><p>“Twenty more.”</p><p>Around that time, as Lee Hyunwoo pushed through his training, two students who were finishing their lectures happened to see him.</p><p>“Hey, that guy’s been running forever, and now he’s straight back to training?”</p><p>“Leave him alone. He’s Bronze. If he has no skill, he’d better make an effort.”</p><p>“You really think that works? If everything could be solved by working hard, then anyone could reach S-rank.”</p><p>It was unclear if they wanted him to hear or if they were talking among themselves. One thing was certain, though: Lee Hyunwoo heard them.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Usually, he might have shrugged it off. Comments like that were everywhere. Wherever you went, people who thought themselves superior belittled others. LFor some reason, it got to him today. He couldn’t let it slide.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo immediately stopped swinging his sword and walked toward them.</p><p>“What was that you said?”</p><p>He disliked being looked down on, but what he hated even more was when someone dismissed “effort” as though it were trivial.</p><p>He found it irritating when people spoke as if anyone could put in the work. Those same people never gave genuine effort themselves, then complained that they saw no results. That hypocrisy repulsed him.</p><p>“What’s your problem?”</p><p>“Apologize. For what you just said.”</p><p>“What? We can’t talk among ourselves?”</p><p>“It’s fine if you keep it between yourselves. The problem is when I hear it.”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo blocked their path as he spoke, and the male student—who had said “anyone could do it”—scowled.</p><p>“Hey, you. Are you pissed off because we’re brushing off Bronze?”</p><p>“I’m not—”</p><p>“Come on, it’s obvious. You’re a first-year too, right? My dear Bronze underclassman. If you’re ashamed of your rank, then stop paying attention to others and just work harder until you move up.”</p><p>“….”</p><p>“You’re mad that a Silver calls a Bronze incompetent? If you don’t like it, rise to Silver. Problem solved.”</p><p>A few choice words came to mind, but Lee Hyunwoo bit them back. That reaction must have looked different to the Silver-ranked student.</p><p>“What’s that look for? Ah, do you think Silver and Bronze are more or less the same?”</p><p>“Hey, knock it off. Let’s just leave.”</p><p>“Go? Right. A first-year who doesn’t even respect his seniors, plus he’s stuck in Bronze? You want me to ignore this? Ridiculous. This is why Bronze keeps thinking Silver is nothing.”</p><p>The male student tossed his jacket to his friend, pulled out his sword, and aimed it at Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>“You’re that angry, huh? Then let’s have a match. I’ll show you why you’re Bronze and why I’m Silver. There’s a clear difference between Bronze and Silver.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Are we doing this or not? Hurry up and answer. If you’re scared, go back to swinging that sword by yourself.”</p><p>Nothing more needed to be said. Lee Hyunwoo grabbed his own sword and faced him. The Silver-ranked student gave a slight grin and added more words:</p><p>“Right. Bronze kids always say they can reach Silver any time they want. They’re deluding themselves and have no clue it’s beyond them. Underclassman, time for a lesson.”</p><p>Anyone who understood how lonely and grueling true effort was never dismissed someone else’s attempts. Those who mocked other people’s efforts didn’t know anything about perseverance.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo, who could overcome even raw talent, decided that the only cure for scum like this was a solid beating.</p><p>“Krk!”</p><p>Barely two seconds into the duel, the Silver-ranked student was slammed down to the floor. Even the student who had suggested the match and the one chosen as referee were in shock.</p><p>“Is that the level of a Silver who talks so much about hard work?”</p><p>“Grrr… you, you cheap jerk! You can’t just rush in right away!”</p><p>“That’s nonsense. I waited for the match to start. That’s not being cheap.”</p><p>“What about the three-second rule of courtesy? What if either side had more to say…?”</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo had no patience for that sort of nonsense.</p><p>Crunch—</p><p>He didn’t even need to swing his sword. One well-placed punch did the job. His opponent was too slow, too talkative, and far too careless. The Silver-ranked student flew away and landed spread-eagle on the ground.</p><p>“So this is what it means to be Silver, but you’re worse than Bronze.”</p><p>He’d already been stressed for the past few days. The biggest reason was how he kept getting beaten by Examiner Baek Seojin, who never held back. He must have accumulated a lot of frustration without realizing it.</p><p>He didn’t have anything against the Examiner, though. He was grateful.</p><p>A loss was most valuable when it came at the hands of someone who had worked even harder. Defeats like that gave him the motivation to push himself to new heights.</p><p>He recognized how much effort Baek Seojin must have invested in honing his skills, since he started with a support-type ability. It had to be unthinkably hard to reach that level.</p><p>He could respect a Silver recognized by Baek Seojin. These punks, however, were worthless. That was his conclusion.</p><p>*</p><p>“What in the world is going on?”</p><p>Kang Hana felt an odd tension in the Academy the moment she arrived for class.</p><p>There was a sense of unrest among the students, and they were looking at each other strangely. It seemed like a fight might have taken place, but something else felt off.</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>When she entered the Student Council room, Yoo Dasom came rushing up to her, out of breath. She clearly looked startled, as though something big had happened.</p><p>“Have you heard the news?!”</p><p>“Dasom, I literally just got here.”</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>Yoo Dasom tapped her head, saying she must be losing it.</p><p>“In any case, it happened yesterday. A first-year Bronze and a second-year Silver had a duel.”</p><p>“A duel? They’re not from the same year, and they’re not even the same rank, right?”</p><p>That combination almost never happened.</p><p>From the second-year’s standpoint, a win was the same as breaking even, and losing meant total disgrace. That alone was enough reason to avoid it. From the first-year’s standpoint, they almost never had the skill to win, so they would try to dodge it altogether.</p><p>Some claimed the gap between Bronze and Silver was minimal, but that gap was real. In the world of abilities, that small difference was still huge.</p><p>Why did the Academy give repeated academic warnings to perpetual Bronze students if not for that gap? There was a recognized difference in skill, usage methods, mindset—one way or another.</p><p>Hana, who was Platinum rank, saw most of them as roughly the same. Yet, she acknowledged that the gap existed. No Bronze had ever beaten a Silver at the Academy until now.</p><p>“…Wait, don’t tell me.”</p><p>Thinking this through, Kang Hana got a sudden inkling.</p><p>No, that had never happened before. Surely, it wasn’t this time either. But Yoo Dasom quickly confirmed her fears.</p><p>“The Silver lost. To a Bronze. And I’m talking total devastation.”</p><p>“That’s impossible…”</p><p>“It gets crazier. Afterward, he took on more Silver students in duels!”</p><p>“Okay, you’re not telling me he won those too, right?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t he? Between yesterday and today, he’s already beaten five Silvers.”</p><p>Yoo Dasom’s affirmation made Kang Hana let out a stunned exclamation. It seemed the Academy was about to explode with rumors.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 38</h1><p>“…Suhyeon, what is going on here?”</p><p>“I… I don’t really know either.”</p><p>We were walking together into the Academy building and saw an entirely different scene from yesterday.</p><p>“See, told you this would happen. Bronze or Silver, they’re basically the same.”</p><p>“Look at those Bronze losers talking so big. That one was just a freak, and you think you can do the same?!”</p><p>“If you got flattened by a Bronze, you should just drop that Silver title, right?!”</p><p>“Come fight us. If you lose, you give up your Silver rank, losers.”</p><p>It was tense. The air felt sharp enough to cut. It was a borderline riot, a chaotic free-for-all about to begin.</p><p>Something had definitely happened. The Academy was quiet the day before, so it was unbelievable it had devolved into this so quickly.</p><p>Particularly regarding the distinctions between ranks.</p><p>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master— Every student strove to climb higher. The higher they stood, the more recognition and the faster their fame spread.</p><p>That strict structure wasn’t just for the top echelons like Platinum or Master. If anything, it was harsher lower down.</p><p>“If I recall, Bronze and Silver are the worst.”</p><p>Bronze folks faced academic warnings. Silver was considered the average rank at the Academy. There was apparently a lot of friction between those two levels because the difference in skill seemed both undeniable and yet not overwhelming.</p><p>From the Bronze side, they’d say that anyone could reach Silver, so it was basically the same. Silver would argue if Bronze students couldn’t even get into Silver, that revealed their true lack of skill.</p><p>Naturally, tensions between them were bound to flare up.</p><p>“Uh, Examiner… from what I’m hearing, there’s a name that keeps coming up.”</p><p>“Whose name?”</p><p>“My Bronze comrade.”</p><p>“Your Bronze comrade… oh, you mean Lee Hyunwoo?”</p><p>“Yes. I just heard that between yesterday and today, he’s defeated multiple Silver students.”</p><p>He must have run into people who stepped on his pride. Lee Hyunwoo wasn’t the type to remain docile when provoked. If a Silver openly disrespected him, a fight was inevitable. And no ordinary Silver could stand against him.</p><p>If they were a Silver on the cusp of Gold, that might be different. Though come to think of it, that still might not be enough. He would probably need a fully qualified Gold to beat Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>“That explains it.”</p><p>A Bronze had beaten a Silver. That had never happened.</p><p>Bronze was considered the bare minimum to remain in the Academy, and Silver was at least the baseline. Had a Bronze shown real skill before? If so, they would have quickly promoted out of Bronze. No one with ability stayed there.</p><p>“Should we intervene? This is too intense.”</p><p>“It’s fine. As soon as a single professor arrives and clears their throat, everyone will disperse.”</p><p>In the Academy or in the outside world, raw strength was the alpha and omega in this realm of abilities.</p><p>Park Junwoo could still swagger around despite being a thug who chased women because he had enough power to back it up. Jung Yuhyeon could cling to his position as vice president because he was steeped in elitism but had the skill to justify it. That Irina was labeled crazy even by villain circles, yet she roamed free, because she held the ability to destroy anything in her path.</p><p>All of them were strong enough to ignore what others thought and do as they pleased. People normally tiptoed around them.</p><p>Bronze or Silver folks saw professors as unstoppable titans. Professors were often in their 30s, still at their prime, so there was no way for a Bronze or Silver to compete.</p><p>But I couldn’t help recalling a question: ‘Why did the professors remain silent when students were targeting the examiners?’</p><p>Maybe they didn’t see it as a severe matter, or perhaps they simply believed that no one had died, so it wasn’t urgent.</p><p>‘…Although, why isn’t anyone stepping in right now?’</p><p>Professors should be appearing to quell this crowd. Dozens of people were gathered, an obvious disturbance, yet no sign of faculty, staff, or even security.</p><p>“Everyone, stop!”</p><p>Instead, the one who showed up was Student Council President Kang Hana.</p><p>“Lecture time is starting soon. Those who have classes, get to your classrooms. Those without classes, stop wasting time like this and do some training.”</p><p>A Platinum senior and Student Council President, no less. The uproar receded quickly at her words.</p><p>Yes, that’s how the world of superhuman abilities worked.</p><p>“Good morning, Examiner.”</p><p>After settling the commotion, Kang Hana noticed me and greeted me.</p><p>“It’s a fine morning, Kang Hana.”</p><p>“I can’t say it’s a fine morning.”</p><p>“Oh, really? I guess that ended up as an unintentional bit of ‘teabagging.’”</p><p>When I raised my hand slightly to convey an apology, Kang Hana waved hers as if to say, “It’s not that big of a deal.”</p><p>“By the way, Examiner, have you heard? About that student who really went all out against you last time.”</p><p>“Lee Hyunwoo, right?”</p><p>“Yes, Lee Hyunwoo—that was his name. I heard that underclassman beat someone from the Silver rank.”</p><p>I nodded, and Kang Hana responded with, “I see,” then scratched her cheek. Just by looking at her, I could tell she was thinking, “This is turning into such a headache.”</p><p>“It seems like there’s some sort of issue. Probably connected to that scene we just saw, right?”</p><p>“Yes. We’ve never had something like this happen before. Usually, if the Silver students provoke the Bronzes, the Bronzes just do whatever it takes to climb up to Silver themselves.”</p><p>“Well, because that’s the simplest and quickest route.”</p><p>It’s extremely difficult for a Bronze to beat a Silver. If it were easy, would the Academy bother to label someone as Bronze and threaten academic warnings over it? Honestly, it makes more sense just to shed that scorned Bronze label as fast as possible.</p><p>“So, having it suddenly go this way is a genuine problem.”</p><p>Then Kang Hana launched into a sudden outpouring of complaints.</p><p>“The way higher-ranked students ignore and look down on those below them is more serious than I thought. It’s a real issue. We all know that. But outside the Academy, it’s worse. At least here, since they’re all students, they keep a certain limit. I tried to fix things, but it caused way too much backlash.”</p><p>“I understand. Out in the real world, getting on the bad side of a high-ranked superhuman can drive you to suicide.”</p><p>“This might sound a bit flimsy, but here at the Academy, the reason we define ranks is to spark healthy competition. If you’re at a higher rank, you get better benefits, right? So that’s how this system was created and why it stays. And because the students know that, they keep quiet about it.”</p><p>“So, Miss Kang Hana, you’re worried that this particular incident is having a very negative effect on that structure?”</p><p>When I asked, Kang Hana paused for a moment, then closed her eyes as though unsure.</p><p>“I really don’t know. Whether it’s a breeze of positive change coming in, or whether it’s just a random outburst from a talented underclassman who’s only going to stay in Bronze for a short while anyway… I can’t say for sure.”</p><p>That remark finally let me figure out what Kang Hana was actually concerned about.</p><p>She wasn’t worried about the Academy’s entire order being upended.  1She was concerned about what would happen to the rest of the Bronze students.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo would inevitably leave Bronze before long, since he was strong enough. But if someone who was just passing through stirred up trouble, only those left behind would be in a difficult position.</p><p>And that made perfect sense.</p><p>In reality, there were no other notable Bronze students right now besides Lee Hyunwoo. (Granted, Kim Suhyeon was a special case, so let’s set her aside.)</p><p>Silver wasn’t drastically better, but it was definitely stronger than Bronze. If Lee Hyunwoo stirred up a fuss, then shot straight out of Bronze, the Bronze students who remained would fall silent again—and end up being the target of huge hostility from the Silver side.</p><p>She was looking further ahead than I’d expected. Turns out she hadn’t become Student Council President for no reason.</p><p>“Um… Senior?”</p><p>At that point, Kim Suhyeon, who had been standing next to us, spoke up softly.</p><p>“You said it’s a problem right now, right? In that case, maybe the Silver students could prove their actual worth. If they do that, wouldn’t things quiet down quickly?”</p><p>“What do you mean, Suhyeon?”</p><p>“Well, Examiner Baek Seojin here is in charge of the Silver rank, right? And my fellow Bronze, Lee Hyunwoo, actually failed the test given by the Examiner. So if the current Silvers earn the Examiner’s recognition, that might just solve everything on its own… that’s what I’m thinking.”</p><p>Hearing this, Kang Hana went, “Huh?” in surprise. And I likewise repeated, “Huh?”—slowly mulling over her suggestion.</p><p>Basically, Lee Hyunwoo had beaten people from Silver but never managed to surpass me, the Silver-rank Examiner. If the Silvers, who do have my seal of approval, stepped in, it would create a reason for Lee Hyunwoo and the other Bronzes to accept them. And so, this fuss could be settled.</p><p>‘Suhyeon, you might just be a genius after all.’</p><p>No wonder she’s the granddaughter of Kang Minseong—our Suhyeon clearly thought it all through.</p><p>“It kinda makes sense, and at the same time, it kind of doesn’t…”</p><p>Kang Hana cocked her head, as if she was sensing something. I was about to jump on the idea and back Suhyeon’s logic when—</p><p>“Excuse me, Examiner Baek Seojin.”</p><p>Suddenly, someone addressed me from behind. I turned around to find a male student wearing a grim expression.</p><p>“I’m sorry to ask out of the blue like this, especially since we’ve never met, but… could I trouble you for a duel instead of a formal evaluation? I have an urgent matter on my hands.”</p><p>Abrupt requests seemed to be an Academy trademark.</p><p>Maybe guessing what was on my mind, Kang Hana stepped closer and whispered: “That’s Chang Juyeol, a second-year. Currently the best among the Silvers.”</p><p>“You mean he’s effectively the Number One Silver?”</p><p>“If we’re being technical, yes. I’m guessing the other Silvers asked him to step in and clean up the situation—show everyone the difference between Bronze and Silver.”</p><p>Wanting to display that gap, sure—but was it really meaningful?</p><p>If they truly wanted to demonstrate that there was a clear gap between Bronze and Silver, shouldn’t they bring out the weakest Silver rather than the best? Prove that even the Silver at the bottom was above a Bronze. That sounded more logical to me.</p><p>“They must be really desperate. Maybe they’re worried that the line between Bronze and Silver will collapse.”</p><p>I was starting to see the same implications that Kang Hana did.</p><p>Passing from Bronze to Silver was the line that determined whether or not you’d get an academic warning. If that boundary became blurry, only Silver would lose out. Hence persuading the strongest Silver to come forward.</p><p>They also hoped to get validation from the “hottest” Silver-rank Examiner in the Academy, reinforcing Silver’s legitimacy and quieting the Bronze revolt.</p><p>‘Let me apologize in advance, kids. Odds are you’re not going to get the result you want…’</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 39</h1><p>‘Chang Juyeol. Second-year, martial arts type. If he’s ranked #1 in Silver, that means he’s probably attempted promotion to Gold multiple times.’</p><p>When I used the “Third Eye” to check him out, I saw that he wasn’t some thug like Park Junwoo or trash like Jung Yuhyeon.</p><p>He was just a normal superhuman. Somewhat talented, somewhat hardworking—an ordinary student, in other words.</p><p>“You say you want a duel. Why all of a sudden?”</p><p>“I’m already in the Silver rank, so I can’t be formally assessed. This isn’t about winning or losing. I just want you to see that we Silver-rank students belong at this level.”</p><p>From his point of view, maybe he’s saying all that because he’s worried he might actually win. Asking for a duel while claiming the outcome doesn’t matter? It’s nonsense. He must see me, a Silver-rank Examiner, as someone not that impressive.</p><p>“Alright, Chang Juyeol. A duel that’s basically an evaluation—let’s give it a try.”</p><p>“Thank you! Let’s get started right away!”</p><p>He turned and began walking toward the examination hall.</p><p>I never imagined keeping my match with Jung Yuhyeon a secret would snowball into this.</p><p>If word had gotten out that I sparred with someone at Gold rank—and beat him—this “easy victory scenario” wouldn’t be happening now.</p><p>No Silver in their right mind would ever challenge an Examiner who even defeated a Gold. They’d say “I’m sorry!” and run for their lives. No one would blame them.</p><p>Of course, an official exam isn’t exactly a duel—winning or losing isn’t the only concern. Examiners try to evaluate objectively; if they find you qualified, you can be promoted.</p><p>What if an Examiner accepted bribes and promoted people arbitrarily, you ask? The students sit through the professors’ lectures anyway, and their skill levels become obvious. These are all folks who have real-world experience; they’re not easy to fool.</p><p>‘Also, if you do get caught doing something shady like that, you go straight to jail.’</p><p>Besides, having a higher rank means you take on more responsibilities.</p><p>If your true level is Bronze, and you jump to Silver, can you really handle it? What if you go on field training and run into a monster or villain you can’t cope with? That’s exactly why both Examiners and students stay away from that kind of fraud.</p><p>Hence, students rarely question their current rank. They do their best, and the Examiner checks them without bias—so everyone is satisfied.</p><p>That goes for something as basic as Silver. So, they ended up quietly looking down on the Bronzes, who hadn’t passed yet.</p><p>Until Lee Hyunwoo came along like a giant wave.</p><p>“Examiner, are you really going through with this?”</p><p>I hadn’t noticed when she caught up, but Kang Hana asked in a worried voice. She must be concerned that, as a government official, I might face trouble for acting on my own.</p><p>I admit I was cautious about that myself during the time with Jung Yuhyeon. Luckily, that arrogant jerk knew enough shame to keep quiet, or else I might have been in a tight spot.</p><p>“Yes, I plan to go through with it.”</p><p>“Isn’t that too risky? You’ll have to file an incident report if something goes wrong, right?”</p><p>“Worst case, sure.”</p><p>I definitely don’t want to file an incident report. Absolutely not.</p><p>But I already spoke with Ma Hakjun—and in a surprisingly positive way. He fell for my sweet talk and asked me to do my best as an Examiner here. He also heard rumors that I might have some connection to Irina. Between those two, I had more than enough cover. In this world, having connections is just as vital as ever.</p><p>“I’m ready now, Examiner.”</p><p>“Great. Before we start, there’s something we have to clarify.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>What else? The very important matter that you might end up in Bronze.</p><p>“If, by chance, you don’t receive a positive assessment from me, what do you plan to do?”</p><p>“Uh? What do you mean…?”</p><p>“From the look of things, you want to surpass the assessment that Lee Hyunwoo failed, so you can prove yourself. Am I wrong?”</p><p>Chang Juyeol said nothing. Because that was exactly his plan. He wasn’t the type to lie calmly about it.</p><p>“If I acknowledge you, then you can show you’ve outdone Lee Hyunwoo. That’s all well and good. But if I judge that you don’t meet the Silver standard, then what will you do?”</p><p>Maybe he already knew the answer but hesitated to say it out loud.</p><p>“Then I guess…”</p><p>He still wouldn’t say it. Maybe he found it too daunting to imagine losing his longtime status as “king of Silver” and dropping to Bronze. He wouldn’t be foolish enough to challenge me if he hadn’t considered the possibility, right?</p><p>“Obviously, you’d lose your Silver status. What more is there to say?”</p><p>“Huh? H-Headmaster?!”</p><p>I had no idea when he arrived, but there was Ma Hakjun, sitting on a nearby bench, laughing. Seriously, is he truly an old man who stepped away from the front lines?</p><p>“Chang Juyeol, can you accept that condition?”</p><p>“W-well… yes, Headmaster. I can.”</p><p>Realizing there was no room to retreat, Chang Juyeol accepted the “back to Bronze” condition in the end. If he refused, that, too, would cause him problems.</p><p>“Then by my authority as Headmaster, let’s call this a special evaluation, Examiner Baek Seojin.”</p><p>“A ‘special evaluation’?”</p><p>“A duel that’s neither a formal test nor quite a spar. Why not call it a special evaluation?”</p><p>Something about the way Ma Hakjun phrased it gave me a strange feeling.</p><p>It looked like he, too, had some ulterior motive.</p><p>Man, old folks are always so inscrutable.</p><p>“Someone wants to move forward, and someone else wants to block them. I’m curious to see how it’ll end.”</p><p>Me too, Headmaster. I’m also curious. Just how many Silvers might drop to Bronze today? From what I can gauge with my special ability—the glimpses I get of others—there seem to be a handful who really do belong in Silver or better besides Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon. At least that’s a relief. I was worried there might be no one.</p><p>*</p><p>‘The Headmaster is here too? This is getting way bigger than I planned!’</p><p>Meanwhile, standing off to the side, Kang Hana silently screamed inside.</p><p>She had gone along with Kim Suhyeon’s suggestion and decided to let Baek Seojin do his thing, because she saw no better way to calm all the unrest in the short term.</p><p>But not all her worries were gone; in fact, this could blow up even more. If someone fails to pass Baek Seojin’s evaluation, then they get dropped to Bronze.</p><p>If the top Silver, Chang Juyeol, couldn’t pass, the rest were almost certainly doomed. If you decided not to take the test, your rank would be ridiculed. If you took it and lost, you dropped to Bronze.</p><p>Either scenario spelled disaster. As Student Council President, her mind was racing.</p><p>‘I know from experience that even Jung Yuhyeon, who was basically Gold, couldn’t beat the Examiner. Chang Juyeol? That’s not going to cut it, let alone any other Silvers.’</p><p>Then all those Silvers would be wiped out. Next, they’d definitely complain. They might even demand re-evaluation of the Gold rank. And given the Examiner’s skill, no one in Gold could stand against him either. Which would mean they’d all be demoted…?</p><p>‘Headmaster, what are you planning by naming it a special evaluation and backing Examiner Baek like this? Are you prepared to completely overturn the Academy’s entire ranking system?’</p><p>And then, as she kept thinking it over—</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>“Wha…?”</p><p>Someone tumbled across the floor and landed facedown. It was indeed Chang Juyeol. This was just ten seconds after their special evaluation had started.</p><p>Kang Hana clutched her head in dismay.</p><p>‘This… this is terrible, isn’t it?!’</p><p>Baek Seojin’s assessment of Chang Juyeol’s Silver rank? He basically answered, “Shut up and stay Bronze. You’re not ready for Silver at all.”</p><p>‘Hold on, so now…’</p><p>She was on the verge of panic.</p><p>“In that case, it looks like we’ll have to reassess the entire Silver rank.”</p><p>Yet Ma Hakjun sat there, laughing with delight as if he were thoroughly enjoying himself.</p><p>It was obvious chaos was brewing now that Baek Seojin had toppled the top Silver, Chang Juyeol. But instead, Ma Hakjun seemed thrilled.</p><p>At that moment, Kang Hana finally understood the Headmaster’s real intentions.</p><p>‘I see! The Headmaster wants to redefine the standard for all these students!’</p><p>If you let water sit still, it’ll stagnate. Once it rots, there’s no turning back. He decided to stir up a storm before that happened.</p><p>Sure, it would cause a lot of fuss, but… He intended to shock the majority who’d been idly complacent—whip them into shape, and raise everyone’s average performance.</p><p>‘Wow, this is serious. We’ll have to stay on guard.’</p><p>Silvers were beaten. They wouldn’t just go down alone. They might drag Gold along with them. Then if Gold got dragged, even her position as Platinum might not be safe.</p><p>For the first time in ages, Kang Hana sensed a crisis. She gazed silently at Baek Seojin.</p><p>‘If he’s not some special agent from who-knows-where, maybe I should try inviting him into my clan?’</p><p>Sure, he’s a government employee now, but clans typically outrank national positions in terms of popularity. If they invite you, rather than you applying, it means big leaps in status. That’s how the superhuman world works.</p><p>‘If we had him, it’d be a huge advantage for the Tower of Magic Clan.’</p><p>While Kang Hana stood there nodding to herself and thinking all kinds of thoughts—</p><p>“…”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon stood by, eyes bright, staring at Baek Seojin with an unwavering gaze.</p><p>Sorry for the late unlock, was busy celebrating Eid.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 40</h1><p>“This is bullshit! Why do we have to go through the Silver evaluation again?!”</p><p>A male student threw down his sword, letting his anger explode.</p><p>“Are you guys really not pissed off? Huh?! It’s not like we cheated, not like we rigged the test. We did everything legit to leave Bronze behind. The Examiners acknowledged it! Am I wrong?”</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>“He’s right, obviously.”</p><p>“Then why are we stuck in this crap?”</p><p>The other students training nearby chimed in. Most of them were Silvers who had been demoted to Bronze, so it was natural for them to get worked up.</p><p>“We can’t just stand around taking this. Sure, the Headmaster is Ma Hakjun, but this is still outrageous.”</p><p>“What do you want to do about it? Got any ideas?”</p><p>“Go public. Spread it to the media that we students strongly oppose it, that it’s way too unfair. That might get things leaning in our favor.”</p><p>Several people nodded as if that was promising.</p><p>“We can even embellish a bit, right?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Something like: A strange new Examiner showed up and started harassing students. He pulled some strings to convince the Headmaster to forcibly demote all the Silvers to Bronze.”</p><p>“It violates the Academy’s own rules, you know. There was no existing process for demotion.”</p><p>“Honestly, I’m disappointed in the Headmaster too. Suddenly inventing a ‘Special Evaluation’? How could we refuse to take it?”</p><p>Voices of discontent grew louder: “We can’t just let this happen!”</p><p>But then, one person spoke up, and everyone else fell silent:</p><p>“Uh, but… that Examiner Baek Seojin isn’t just any old Examiner. Word has it he’s got connections to Irina.”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>“Crap.”</p><p>Irina. For aspiring superhumans, she’s simultaneously a figure of admiration and terror. If you piss her off, she’ll crush you like a villain. The infamous “crazy blonde,” rumored to be absolutely unhinged. She didn’t get called ‘that crazy woman’ for nothing.</p><p>“I was wondering… maybe Ms. Irina is unhappy with our skill levels and she’s the one pushing from behind, using this Examiner as her front?”</p><p>“S-shit, that’s disturbingly plausible.”</p><p>“So if we fight back against this…?”</p><p>“It’s basically picking a fight with that maniac woman.”</p><p>They were all big talkers a moment ago, even acting like Ma Hakjun was no big deal. But the name Irina, shut them all down instantly.</p><p>Ma Hakjun might be a kindly old gentleman who still knows boundaries, but… that insane blonde will smash you with a smile on her face.</p><p>“So does that mean… we’re just stuck in Bronze forever?”</p><p>“That’d be even worse. We worked so hard just to get out of Bronze…”</p><p>They had believed that, once they escaped Bronze, all would be well. No more academic warnings, they could coast along, graduate comfortably. A typical C-rank assignment would be their limit after graduation, but that was enough to live on.</p><p>Sure, stronger monsters and more dangerous villains existed, but they’d let the truly talented folks handle that. As for them, they’d just keep the minor threats in check. In a stable world, that was enough for them. They didn’t care about pushing higher.</p><p>“How am I supposed to explain this at home? My folks already got mad, asking if I got demoted or something.”</p><p>“Why’d you tell them? I’m hiding it.”</p><p>“I am too. I can’t admit it. If my parents find out I could still get an academic warning, they’d freak out.”</p><p>They wanted to complain so badly, but the threat behind their enemy was terrifying. And they hated swallowing their pride to endure it. They all sighed, not really focusing on training.</p><p>“Hey, students.”</p><p>Then someone approached from the training hall entrance, someone every student recognized at once: The Silver-rank Examiner, Baek Seojin.</p><p>“Oh, hell no.”</p><p>“Why’s he here again? You here to pick a fight?”</p><p>Of course, none of them reacted kindly. He was the man who’d thrown them back into the hell pit called Bronze. How could they possibly welcome him with a smile?</p><p>“I’ve come to deliver some good news.”</p><p>‘Good news, my ass. Your presence is bad news all by itself.’</p><p>“For now, no one’s getting an academic warning just for being in Bronze.”</p><p>“…Huh?”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Seriously?!”</p><p>The student crowd’s mood flipped in an instant. Their biggest, scariest problem was the dreaded academic warning. All their complaints and frustrations had revolved around that.</p><p>“Yes, everyone. I just spoke with the Headmaster. While we reorganize the ranking system, we decided penalizing you for being in Bronze would be unfair. So until everything settles, you can forget about academic warnings.”</p><p>“Wooooooo!”</p><p>“Yes! We’re saved!”</p><p>Baek Seojin silently watched them cheer in relief.</p><p>‘Sure enough, the academic warning issue caused the strongest hostility.’</p><p>Even in a normal college, an academic warning is terrifying. In a superhuman academy, where failing can get you expelled, it’s a nightmare. No wonder they reacted so fiercely.</p><p>“I hope this eases your burdens, even if just a bit.”</p><p>“It totally does! Thank you, Examiner! Holy crap, what a relief.”</p><p>“It’s definitely confirmed, right? The Headmaster won’t suddenly change his mind and slap warnings on us again, yeah?”</p><p>“How long is this suspension period? They didn’t say exactly, did they?”</p><p>He told them the professors and the Headmaster were still deciding. But it wouldn’t be a short suspension, and if they ever reinstated the warnings, it would be announced at least two weeks in advance—so there was no reason to worry.</p><p>The students nodded, seeming to accept that.</p><p>“Excuse me, Examiner.”</p><p>However, they still had some lingering resentment. It’s not that easy to wash away the frustration they’d built up.</p><p>“We do appreciate your concern—truly. But the bottom line is, why are we demoted back to Bronze? We didn’t cheat or anything. We got assessed by other Examiners and made it to Silver fair and square.”</p><p>“Exactly. It’s not like we scammed the results. We had a valid assessment from other Examiners.”</p><p>They still found the present situation unfair. They wanted an explanation.</p><p>“Of course, I understand your anger and annoyance. I knew from the start I’d be cursed at for doing this. But I have a reason for it.”</p><p>To them, what matters most is the reality in front of their eyes. Hence, Baek Seojin planned to layer a different reality on top of that.</p><p>“Not too long ago, one of my friends died in the line of duty.”</p><p>This was true. One of his acquaintances had indeed been killed by a monster. Not exactly a close friend, more like someone he’d occasionally greeted.</p><p>“He was a C-rank superhuman. An ordinary superhuman, just like everyone else. That day, he was just living his normal life—until he happened to meet a particularly dangerous C-rank monster and lost his life.”</p><p>“…I’m sorry to hear that.”</p><p>“Thank you. Now, let me ask you something, everyone. Do you know which superhuman rank suffers the highest casualty rate right now?”</p><p>One student hesitantly raised a hand.</p><p>“C-rank.”</p><p>“That’s correct. Now, in Academy terms, that’s basically Silver. Right?”</p><p>“Yes, Examiner, but that statement is misleading.”</p><p>Baek Seojin gestured for him to continue.</p><p>“C-rank has the most casualties simply because there are more C-rankers than any other rank. We can’t say C-rankers died because they’re weak or unskilled.”</p><p>He had a point: more people at that rank naturally means more casualties in total. It would be wrong to twist that into “They all died because they lacked skill.”</p><p>“Yes, I agree. But do you really think the higher numbers alone explain why more people die? I don’t see it that way.”</p><p>“…You’re implying you doubt the competence of C-rank superhumans?”</p><p>“You keep twisting my words. That’s not what I’m trying to say.”</p><p>“Then what do you want?” The student, voice tense, stared him down. It was obvious these students didn’t have a favorable view of Baek Seojin right now. Sensing that he had to make a move, Baek Seojin went all in.</p><p>“I just don’t want any of you to share my friend’s fate.”</p><p>He forced a slight smile with a hint of sorrow in his voice. A somber expression for extra effect.</p><p>“I don’t want any of you to die a pointless death. Isn’t that tragic? You’re finally getting somewhere, yet you get taken out in some ridiculous way. If only you’d had a little more luck, maybe you’d have lived. So that’s why I’m playing the villain here—to do whatever I can to prevent that tragedy.”</p><p>At least they can see he knows he’s playing the bad guy.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s be honest. What do I stand to gain by doing this? I’m getting cursed at left and right. You all resent me. I get absolutely nothing out of it.”</p><p>A lie—he stood to gain a lot, but the students had no idea.</p><p>“Right… I guess so.”</p><p>“Yeah, come to think of it, there’s no benefit for the Examiner in this.”</p><p>“And at the Academy, they say you can shed sweat instead of blood. My hope is that you do just that. Even if you’re both Silver-level C-rank, the one who has put in the extra work, just a bit more, has a better chance to survive.”</p><p>‘I’m not doing this for my own gain. I’m doing it to help you. I really mean it.’</p><p>No one was going to break down crying with gratitude. But at least the number of people who hated him or might oppose him fiercely went down. Because, typically, people can be moved by even a little contrived drama.</p><p>“I don’t want to turn Silver promotions into an impenetrable fortress. I just want you to show a little more effort than before. As long as I can be sure you won’t meet the same fate as my friend, that’ll be enough.”</p><p>At first, I was cussed out, physically attacked, and hammered with complaints. But over time, as I got more experience, I developed the kind of persuasion that could even make nasty complainers feel a twinge of guilt and walk away. I was using that skill in full force on these relatively inexperienced students.</p><p>Yuyu: I don’t know where he’s going with this but… okay…</p><p>7 (goals: 48 votes) more votes on NovelBin to reach the vote goals. 1 extra chapters will be unlocked if we reached the vote goals.</p><p>Happy reading!</p><p>If you enjoyed the novel, please leave a rating and review on NovelBin.

The moment she arrived, she sought out Ma Hakjun and questioned him.</p><p>“I’m not sure what you mean, Professor Han.”</p><p>“Oh, come on. Don’t play dumb. You know exactly what I’m talking about, and it’s really throwing me off.”</p><p>At her scolding, Ma Hakjun let out a soft chuckle. He gestured for her to sit, then spoke slowly:</p><p>“I only did what I was supposed to do as the Headmaster.”</p><p>“So, why do it now, of all times?”</p><p>She patted her chest in frustration.</p><p>“If you shake things up like this, what’s going to happen to the Academy lectures? They’re divided by rank.”</p><p>“We’ll just have to re-teach them. The professors who handled Silver classes can handle Bronze, no?”</p><p>“What about field training?”</p><p>“Bronze students don’t do field training anyway, and there aren’t many Silvers left, so I see no problem.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you just hate how the ranking system has become some rigid status hierarchy?”</p><p>People sometimes called the ranking system a new “caste.” Originally, the idea was to categorize missions by difficulty and assign them based on skill. But now, it’s transformed into a means of preserving each rank’s privileges.</p><p>That same rigid order extended to the Academy, too. They claimed it was meant to separate levels and give appropriate training, but in reality, the ranks ended up pitting students against each other.</p><p>“I know there’s been a lot of talk about the rank system. It’s serious, I get it. But doing this is going to cause massive chaos. You think those Silver students will just accept it quietly?”</p><p>“Of course not. Some might recognize their own weaknesses and remain silent, but others won’t.”</p><p>“Exactly! So they’ll rebel in some form. And that’s not the end—they’ll say, ‘why only us?’ and drag Gold down, too. That means we’ll have internal conflicts. Is that what you want, especially during these times when villains can exploit any chaos?”</p><p>If a big internal fight erupted now—somebody might get hurt during a duel, or worse. No one could say for sure if it was a mere accident or a planned terror attack by villains.</p><p>“I even met that Examiner, Baek Seojin. I assumed he’d only crack down on a few Silvers as an example, telling them to ‘put in more effort’… but he’s ready to demote all of them to Bronze.”</p><p>“That’s because I quietly encouraged him to do so. He seems willing as well.”</p><p>“What? Are you serious?”</p><p>At her question, Ma Hakjun nodded calmly. He wasn’t saying it just to defend Baek Seojin; he meant every word.</p><p>“No way…”</p><p>Han Jiyoon exhaled a long sigh and collapsed into the chair, massaging her temples.</p><p>“I admit a lot of the students here have a disappointing skill level. It’s frustrating. But you’re not just talking about skill, are you?”</p><p>“It’s not only skill, Jiyoon. It’s their mindset.”</p><p>“Their mindset?”</p><p>“Yes. Most of our students lack a sense of urgency. They just want to settle for what they have.”</p><p>In their minds, let stronger superhumans deal with the hardest missions. The world is stable anyway, so they can handle small monsters or petty villains. That’s enough.</p><p>“But that’s not necessarily wrong, is it? Maybe that’s just their way of trying to live more comfortably.”</p><p>Han Jiyoon’s question made Ma Hakjun nod in agreement. It’s not inherently evil to take the safe path. It’s just a personal choice.</p><p>“The real problem is something else. If it becomes the norm to dismiss the choice of pushing yourself further—if people start calling it ‘nonsense’ or ‘a waste of time’—that’s bad.”</p><p>“So, in a stagnating environment, you wanted to create a wave of change.”</p><p>Yes. The majority were Bronze or Silver, and just a few in Gold or higher. They’d graduate with their moderate abilities, then take on moderate tasks. Ma Hakjun was worried about that.</p><p>Han Jiyoon fell silent for a moment, then took a small breath and spoke:</p><p>“Alright, I get it. I really do. But you realize how complicated this will get, right? The staff who oversaw the old Silver promotions, maybe even the higher ranks, will have their methods questioned. Those professors will be in a tough spot. Have you thought about how to deal with that?”</p><p>“Yes, I have exactly one solution.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun smiled. Han Jiyoon muttered, “Seriously, old man? Don’t tell me…” under her breath.</p><p>“You plan to use Examiner Baek Seojin?”</p><p>“‘Use’ is a harsh word. Let’s say we’ll ask him for help.”</p><p>“That’s the same thing. Basically, you’ll have him show his true abilities to the students, right?”</p><p>He was someone who’d failed to enter the Academy or a field unit. Through blood and sweat, he rose to an extraordinary level. Yet he didn’t join a field unit or a clan—he stayed at the Academy as a Silver-rank Examiner, proving that a bit more effort can take you far beyond where you started.</p><p>“And sure, it’s tough, maybe even painful, but it’ll bring about real change. Look at that Lee Hyunwoo boy—despite having enough talent, he deliberately takes on massive challenges to push himself.”</p><p>“He’s a weirdo. Do you think it’s easy to train that hard?”</p><p>Ma Hakjun and Han Jiyoon had been keeping an eye on Lee Hyunwoo for a while. They recognized him as a future powerhouse.</p><p>Han Jiyoon scratched her cheek, then stood up. She’d just returned to the Academy and was about to be swamped by the fallout from this new “Examiner.” That was the reality.</p><p>“Oh, by the way, did you find out what I asked you to check?”</p><p>“For the most part, yes.”</p><p>She’d left partly at Ma Hakjun’s request. She handed some documents over to him.</p><p>“I dug pretty deep, but there was nothing. No hidden secrets.”</p><p>“So, he’s just someone whose abilities awakened belatedly after all…”</p><p>He tapped the table, looking thoughtful.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Han Jiyoon, frowning slightly, spoke cautiously:</p><p>“It’s odd. Usually if you keep digging, you find a scrap of information or two. But his record is squeaky clean. It might just be that he became an orphan during a Gate incident, but… aside from his name and ID number, there’s nothing. Like…”</p><p>“Someone purposely erased it?”</p><p>“This is just speculation. It’s just so empty.”</p><p>Ma Hakjun let out a hum, looking at the documents she’d handed him.</p><p>“I’m not saying we should distrust him. I just… you know…”</p><p>“I understand. Don’t worry. Neither I, nor Kang Minseong, nor you, nor even that crazy blonde have sensed anything off about him, correct?”</p><p>“True…” she murmured, nodding.</p><p>Baek Seojin - A name printed beside a single ID photo.</p><p>…</p><p>“Me too! I want to take the Special Evaluation!”</p><p>Sure, you too!</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>And you as well!</p><p>“I’d like to challenge you, Examiner.”</p><p>You too—everyone’s going back to Bronze!</p><p>“Remember, if you fail my assessment, you’ll be automatically returned to Bronze. No point in filing objections. Keep that in mind.”</p><p>Just today alone, over thirty Silvers got sent back to Bronze. And there are still well over a hundred Silvers left in the Academy. Plus all the Bronze students who’ve been there from the start.</p><p>Truly, it’s an endless wellspring of fresh opportunities!</p><p>‘Ma Hakjun really planned this out well.’</p><p>From a Silver’s perspective, they can’t afford not to take the Special Evaluation. If they refuse, the Bronzes will mock them harder. They can grit their teeth and refuse, but will their newly Bronze friends let that slide? They’ll pressure them until they agree.</p><p>Humans can’t stand being the only one at a disadvantage. If your friend was forced down to Bronze with you while you stayed Silver, that’s not going to fly.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Bronzes have been motivated by Lee Hyunwoo. They realized that if they push themselves hard enough, they can achieve something. A Bronze beating a Silver? Unheard of until now. No doubt some of them are fired up. If they can leap to Silver while ex-Silvers are dropping to Bronze, it would be a total reversal!</p><p>‘So the ex-Silvers want to reclaim their lost glory, while the Bronzes see a shot at vengeance. If they’re at all serious, they’ll go all-in.’</p><p>The Academy, which had been like a calm lake, is now raging with waves. And Ma Hakjun secretly called me in to say:</p><p>“I’ve already told the Academy that academic warnings for staying in Bronze are suspended for now. We can’t sabotage a drastic measure aimed at positive change. If anyone shows resistance, feel free to mention my name—say the Headmaster asked you to do it.”</p><p>A headmaster who’ll lend his authority whenever needed. Much better than the manager in my own department, who always tries to slip away when we have to work late. If only all public officials could be like him!</p><p>“Examiner! I’m challenging the Silver rank test!”</p><p>Of course, nobody knows how long this wave will last. It could just be a brief flash.</p><p>If in the end, no one passes, no one grows, all the reasons behind this vanish into thin air.</p><p>‘So Lee Hyunwoo, Kim Suhyeon, I really need you two. Plus any other Bronze or Silver out there who’s got the potential—give it all you’ve got!’</p><p>I’ve already set a target: I want a Bronze student who can beat a Gold. If that happens, we can bring the Gold rankers into this mess too. Imagine a Bronze who fights like a Gold—just the thought is exciting.</p><p>And right then, a brand new message popped up:</p><p>◎ Notification</p><p>The required cooldown period has ended.</p><p>Yes, this is it!

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 42</h1><p>“Whew! Whew!”</p><p>Today, once again, Lee Hyunwoo’s routine was exactly the same as usual.</p><p>He woke up early in the morning and ran full speed to build his stamina without a single pause. Next, he grabbed his sword and practiced as a weapon-type superhuman, honing his fundamental skills.</p><p>After that, he headed to his theory lectures. They weren’t fun and had no emotional payoff, just pure, boring drudgery. Even so, Lee Hyunwoo kept his eyes wide open, focusing intently on each lecture.</p><p>“You’ll regret it if you ignore the theory classes, Lee Hyunwoo.”</p><p>He’d once complained at length about how pointless the theory lectures felt. In response, Examiner Baek Seojin shook his head and warned him to keep at it.</p><p>“They might seem useless now, but a day will come when you need them. ‘How can I be sure?’ Because that’s just how the world is. Anything you learn, you’ll eventually need. And the stuff you skip because ‘I’ll never use it’ inevitably comes back to bite you.”</p><p>It was advice from none other than Examiner Baek Seojin. He must have had his reasons—he definitely knew something. Convinced of that, Lee Hyunwoo nodded and poured extra energy into the lectures.</p><p>And then, after the torment of those classes ended, came the moment Lee Hyunwoo most looked forward to:</p><p>the chance to take his Silver-rank evaluation under Examiner Baek Seojin.</p><p>‘Lately, that’s the most fun part of my day.’</p><p>Some might say, “What’s so fun about failing to advance?” But Lee Hyunwoo didn’t see it like that.</p><p>It wasn’t a win-or-lose spar, nor was it a life-or-death battle.</p><p>He got to test out all his effort, newly devised strategies, and refined tactics. And his opponent, Examiner Baek Seojin, had the skill to handle everything Lee Hyunwoo could bring. A chance to go all out against someone so strong was almost impossible to come by.</p><p>‘Usually, real pros head for bigger stages right away, making it nearly impossible to meet them.’</p><p>Maybe that’s what Headmaster Ma Hakjun had in mind: finding someone capable of fully handling the students’ challenges, no matter how hard they pushed.</p><p>The Academy’s professors were already swamped with lectures, and Professor Han Jiyoon had to fill the role of the Academy’s sword as well.</p><p>Which meant Examiner Baek Seojin was the perfect solution. He himself wanted that role, and it was literally his job to oversee these tests.</p><p>“Grrgh!”</p><p>“You did well, Lee Hyunwoo.”</p><p>“Haha… Thank you, Examiner.”</p><p>Again, Lee Hyunwoo, that Bronze rank, ended up getting knocked down by Baek Seojin. He grinned and got to his feet.</p><p>He thought he’d done fairly well, but in the end, he’d run out of steam. Regrettable, but that was it for today—and that was fine. There was always tomorrow. If he trained more today, worked harder overnight, he could come back for another try tomorrow.</p><p>‘That just means I’m still not training enough! I need to work harder!’</p><p>So he’d rinse and repeat his morning routine once more: training, training, and more training—longer and more intense than the day before.</p><p>Sometimes it was grueling, enough to make him question what he was doing with his life. But all those doubts vanished whenever he closed his eyes and pictured the future version of himself. That was enough to chase away any hesitation.</p><p>On top of that, he wasn’t alone in this anymore.</p><p>“Haah! Hyaat!”</p><p>“Huff, huff!”</p><p>Ever since the launch of the “Special Evaluations,” more people had been coming to the training halls.</p><p>Some were pouring sweat because they wanted to seize this golden opportunity. Others were trying to reclaim what they had lost. This was how it should be. Yes, this was what an Academy ought to look like.</p><p>Bronze students simply needed to reach Silver, and once they did, they often got complacent. Until recently, that was exactly how most Academy students behaved. It was only less common for the Gold tier and above.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo couldn’t understand them at all.</p><p>If they could still grow stronger, and they had the means and the time to train, why settle? There’s no immediate crisis just because the Silver count is low. What if, later on, that “just enough for Silver” proved woefully insufficient?</p><p>‘In that sense, the Academy right now is a proper Academy!’</p><p>Everyone had a reason to grit their teeth and push themselves. Watching them fired up Lee Hyunwoo’s own competitive streak—he wouldn’t lose to them!—and so he threw himself into training with even more fervor.</p><p>It was the moment a wave of training fever swept through what had been a placid Academy.</p><p>…</p><p>A blade, surging with killer intent, whistled right past me, close enough to brush my torso. It moved so fast that, for a split second, I almost froze and just stared.</p><p>‘…What was that?’</p><p>A cold sweat trickled down my spine.</p><p>If I’d been even a tiny bit slower, what would’ve happened then?</p><p>The mere thought made me shudder.</p><p>‘Sure enough, I can’t rely on my Gatekeeper Trait and let my guard down.’</p><p>That Trait doesn’t make me invincible—it just raises my chances. Up to now, I’ve managed because my opponents have been within my capacity.</p><p>If an Elder, like last time, shows up again, then trait or not, I’m done. Back then, I survived only because Ma Hakjun intervened. There’s no guarantee he’d be around for a second time.</p><p>Which means if that happens again, forget Gatekeeping—I’ll be meeting the Grim Reaper.</p><p>“Hah… hah…”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon gasped harshly, staggering to her feet. Unlike before, she didn’t stand there apologizing, all flustered. She didn’t even seem aware of what she’d just pulled off.</p><p>“Judging you to be in no shape to continue, I’ll end the evaluation here, Kim Suhyeon.”</p><p>“Th… thank you for your time….”</p><p>As soon as I said that, she sank back to the floor.</p><p>I’d kept her going even after she began wobbling from exhaustion, pushing her right to the edge. Once you experience that boundary enough times, you’ll eventually break through. If anyone can do it, she can.</p><p>‘And that moment just now? It was actually really dangerous.’</p><p>Her stamina was completely spent, and she lost her balance momentarily. I leapt in to exploit that opening, but she suddenly swung her sword. She wasn’t reacting to my position in her field of vision—she couldn’t even see me. Her body just moved on its own at the crucial moment.</p><p>She really was built differently from the average student.</p><p>She still hasn’t fully awakened, but she’s overflowing with talent. That clan bloodline didn’t lie. People weren’t joking when they said her lineage ran strong.</p><p>After all, that’s probably why her Trait included the word “genius.” Of all the students I’ve met, only Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon have “genius” in their details.</p><p>◎ No Pain, No Gain</p><p>Trait activated</p><p>Target – Kim Suhyeon</p><p>Stack 3</p><p>Three stacks. Not enough. Still a long way to go. Lee Hyunwoo’s nearing double digits because he’s shown up every single day without fail. Meanwhile, Kim Suhyeon couldn’t handle daily challenges due to her chronic stamina issues.</p><p>I’d like to push her even more, but it’s too soon for that. Right now, what she needs isn’t pressure but confidence-boosting support.</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>“Yes, Examiner?”</p><p>“I mean it: you’re seriously impressive.”</p><p>As soon as I said that, I realized how weird it sounded—like an empty compliment with no substance.</p><p>Maybe she felt the same, because she shook her head as if to say, “That can’t be true.”</p><p>“No, Suhyeon. I’m not just saying it.”</p><p>“It’s alright, Examiner. You don’t have to… I’m really okay.”</p><p>Seriously, I’m telling the truth here. Feels kind of unfair that she won’t believe me.</p><p>She clearly still lacks confidence in herself. From my perspective, she’s more than good enough to believe in her own skills. Why does she sell herself short…?</p><p>Oh. Right. She’s from the family of Kang Minseong on her mother’s side, isn’t she?</p><p>Well, that explains it. No wonder she’s forever comparing herself to that clan of overachievers. Kang Minseong’s not the only remarkable one—his children are all strong superhumans, and his grandchildren, too. I remember seeing something in the news a while ago.</p><p>But that only applies if you measure yourself against those monstrous relatives. From the Academy’s perspective, they’d scold her for fussing over a “mere 92 points” in front of a bunch of 50-point stragglers.</p><p>“Sure, your stamina issues keep holding you back—definitely something you need to fix. But as a weapon-type, your skills are so sharp it’s almost scary. You may not remember, but you nearly counterattacked me just by reflex when I closed in.”</p><p>“I… did?”</p><p>She had no idea, so I nodded, and she murmured some vague noise while fiddling with her fingers. She looked anxious getting praised for something she didn’t even realize she’d done.</p><p>“You’re not untalented. You’re not weaker than anyone else. Everyone’s basically the same. The difference is whether you have enough faith in yourself to think, decide, and act. That’s it.”</p><p>We all know how, in the original storyline, she only gained that unwavering drive after she was brainwashed, turning her into the Crimson Witch. She overcame her hesitancy, and that synergy turned her into an immensely powerful villain.</p><p>That headache gave even the cheat-level protagonist, Lee Hyunwoo, a tough time.</p><p>“You’re doing great, Suhyeon.”</p><p>Just that bit of encouragement made her face go bright red.</p><p>She’s pure as can be—definitely doesn’t need some twisted brainwashing. If she awakens this potential naturally, she’d be one of the best allies any superhuman could ask for.</p><p>‘She’s not uncontrollable like that psycho Irina, either.’</p><p>…Though, honestly, I can’t say I have zero worries. I haven’t forgotten those red eyes and how she briefly discarded her reason. But I think we can handle it.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>Right then, I spotted the illustrious ex-Gold, the source of that trigger, passing in the distance.</p><p>“Jung Yuhyeon! You’re not taking an evaluation?”</p><p>He’s been strangely quiet, so I decided to toss out a little taunt. With his arrogant attitude, he’d never just let that go… right?</p><p>But…</p><p>‘What the heck’s with that guy?’</p><p>The moment he saw me, he flinched like I was a ghost and ran away.</p><p>Yuyu: Of course, he&#39;s scared of Irina. 🙄</p><p>Let&#39;s goo!!! 1 (goals: 48 votes) more votes on NovelBin to reach the vote goals. 1 extra chapters will be unlocked if we reached the vote goals.</p><p>Happy reading!</p><p>If you enjoyed the novel, please leave a rating and review on NovelBin.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 43</h1><p>“Why the hell hasn’t there been any word yet?!”</p><p>Jung Yuhyeon hurled a dagger across the room, snarling. He’d been assured everything was ready—that “they’d handle it for the money they got,” clear and simple.</p><p>They weren’t amateurs or con men with fancy words. They were “professionals” who’d carried out similar operations many times. Their methods were filthy, but they were certainly reliable enough to be called pros.</p><p>That was why he trusted them—he even handed over a share of his “interests,” the most crucial portion, just to get rid of Baek Seojin. Because to Jung Yuhyeon, that man was a humiliating reminder of something he never wanted to face again.</p><p>He’d lost to a mere Silver Examiner without even putting up a fight, while he was basically a Gold-level student. Not to mention being the Student Council’s Vice President. It was a total disgrace.</p><p>‘I spent so much effort buying my way into the Vice President seat.’</p><p>Skill alone wasn’t enough. He also needed the students’ support and a respectable image. Being true to himself, he solved those problems with money, deals, and blackmail, all behind the scenes.</p><p>That was how he became Vice President, only to be placed on probation after a few short months. “Probation” basically meant having his Vice President status put on ice, so his anger burned, ready to explode at any moment.</p><p>“…Uh, hyung? No news yet? Telling me to wait it out? Isn’t this too slow? Are they sure they’re doing their job right? They’d better not run off with the share I gave them!”</p><p>He even got a dose of “You think I’m like you?” in return. Furious as that made him, he tried to suppress it—he desperately needed results.</p><p>All he wanted was for that man to vanish from the Academy, from the world. And if it tarnished that man’s name with all sorts of scorn, so much the better.</p><p>Yet before long, he learned a shocking truth.</p><p>“…What the hell is this.”</p><p>Every TV news channel, every online article, even the newspapers… all of them were splashing the face of Baek Seojin everywhere. Or at least he kept showing up in the shots.</p><p>Technically, Baek Seojin wasn’t the main subject—he was just in the photos next to the real star. But for Jung Yuhyeon, that alone was overwhelming.</p><p>‘Th-that’s Irina. Why is she shaking hands with him?’</p><p>South Korea’s mightiest superhuman—and also its biggest lunatic. If you pissed her off, she’d crush you whether you were a villain or not. The country itself was wary of her.</p><p>She had as many fans as she did haters. But in the end, no one questioned her strength—she was among the best of the best.</p><p>Word was that a corporate heir tried to court her and ended up with a busted… well, you get the idea. A high-ranking clan officer also tried hitting on her and got all their limbs broken. There was a reason even villains called her the “crazy blonde.”</p><p>So… Irina was photographed with Baek Seojin, actually shaking hands with a relaxed smile?</p><p>‘N-no way. Maybe it’s just a coincidence…?’</p><p>Irina, smiling while shaking hands with someone, letting reporters photograph them? This was the same Irina who greeted paparazzi with curses and the middle finger. Even an idiot could see that they clearly had some connection.</p><p>Which meant Baek Seojin was personally acquainted with the last person on earth you’d ever want to piss off.</p><p>‘Thank God.’</p><p>As soon as he realized that, Jung Yuhyeon felt relieved. He still believed nothing had been set in motion yet, so at least the worst catastrophe had been avoided.</p><p>“Hey, you little bastard! Get your ass home now!”</p><p>That relief was shattered by the furious roar of his grandfather, Jinhan, the group’s honorary chairman.</p><p>He was the person in this world who scared Jung Yuhyeon most. The moment the day’s lectures ended, Yuhyeon rushed home. Why was his grandfather so enraged?</p><p>As soon as he stepped inside the house: “You insane brat! How far did you go, huh?!”</p><p>Honorary Chairman Jinhan was waiting for him, golf club in hand.</p><p>“G-Grandfather, what’s—?”</p><p>“What’s with me? Hey, you worthless punk, do you have any idea what kind of chaos you’ve caused? Number Two, you tell him. Make sure he hears how serious this is!”</p><p>Only then did Jung Yuhyeon realize that his two older brothers and his father were also there, each one groaning like they, too, had been whacked by that golf club.</p><p>“Hyung, what is—?”</p><p>“Yesterday, the entire group’s affiliates—Irina flattened them.”</p><p>“…Huh?”</p><p>“Yes, I mean it. She literally swept them clean.”</p><p>They weren’t monsters or villains, so what the hell was he talking about? Yuhyeon had no clue how this had happened—why that woman had come after them.</p><p>But his brother’s next words were even more shocking: Out of nowhere, the prosecution launched a massive search-and-seizure operation against their corporate branches. Their moles within the police promptly disappeared.</p><p>Everything was carried out so covertly and swiftly that the media barely noticed. Or maybe the news cycle was too fixated on some unprecedented Gate incident that bypassed a protective barrier.</p><p>“W-why is this happening…?”</p><p>“What do you think, you idiot? The job you asked them to do! Your target was linked to that psycho woman! And now that psycho’s on the rampage, the government has realized how serious it is. They’re dissecting all our connections! We can’t get help from anyone because they’re all going underground in terror!”</p><p>“N-no! But how the hell did they figure out our connection? You said they were tight-lipped! I just trusted what you told me. You said they’d never failed or leaked anything before!”</p><p>“Shit! That’s not the point! The problem is who the hell you messed with!”</p><p>From Jung Yuhyeon’s perspective, he did feel it was unfair.</p><p>If he had known Baek Seojin was an acquaintance of Irina, he would never have done anything.</p><p>After all, getting on that crazy woman’s bad side was a one-way ticket out of this world. She might not care about most things, but messing with anyone under her protection was absolutely off-limits!</p><p>“What are we supposed to do about this mess?! We bribed them so much, but the moment that woman growled, everyone panicked and vanished on us! Nobody’s left to help our side!”</p><p>Only then did Jung Yuhyeon realize how hopelessly everything had spiraled out of control. It wasn’t just losing to a random Examiner or being suspended as Vice President. If this continued, he could lose all the powerful backing that had secured his status.</p><p>That day, his grandfather beat him savagely. He felt wronged and had so many questions, but there was no fixing something that was already out in the open.</p><p>When he eventually returned to the Academy, he found the situation had gotten worse. Somehow, Baek Seojin—who seemed to have connections to Irina—was also backed by the Headmaster. And now he was demoting the Silver students to Bronze, telling them to undergo evaluation again.</p><p>With things going this way, the next obvious target was him. He’d already been forcibly dropped from Gold once, setting a precedent.</p><p>‘If that gets out, every Gold-ranked student might turn against me!’</p><p>Who had he tried to mess with? Damn it! How did it all end up like this?</p><p>He clutched his head in frustration, on the verge of screaming from anger and helplessness.</p><p>All he’d wanted was to “teach a lesson” to some uppity Examiner. If he’d known that guy had such insane backing, he’d never have dared.</p><p>[Our next update: The investigation into Jinhan Group is underway…]</p><p>[Today, prosecutors announced the results of their raid on Jinhan Group’s…]</p><p>Meanwhile, his own “backers” were steadily going under. There was no end in sight. The prosecutors weren’t going to hold back, because if they did, it was obvious who would take matters into her own hands next.</p><p>Honestly, letting the prosecution run wild was safer. If Irina moved again, the entire “Jinhan” name could be wiped off the map in South Korea.</p><p>‘Shit, shit, shit… This wasn’t part of my plan! I never meant it to go this far!’</p><p>At first, he felt a twinge of guilt, but as always happens with people like him, he gradually channeled that anger onto someone else—namely, the one he blamed for this entire fiasco: Baek Seojin.</p><p>“If it weren’t for that bastard Baek Seojin… if it weren’t for that son of a bitch…”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he muttered curses he’d never dare say to the man’s face.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Some figures stood quietly at a distance, watching him.</p><p>A short while later…</p><p>“…What kind of bullshit situation is this?”</p><p>“I have no idea, so don’t ask me. I’m just passing on exactly what the guys inside told us.”</p><p>At the big, shadowy man’s words, the one-eyed woman gave a baffled smile.</p><p>Could it be Ma Hakjun, that old fogey, finally went senile? Or did the Academy get a brand-new lunatic?</p><p>They were forcibly dropping perfectly fine Silvers back to Bronze. Some said even Gold would be next on the list.</p><p>At first, both the reporter and the recipient had just scoffed. It was too ridiculous—completely unheard of.</p><p>But the more they looked into it, the stranger it seemed. There should be plenty of pushback, and the Academy’s entire curriculum should be in turmoil. If even the man called Ma Hakjun was behind it, he had a deeper agenda.</p><p>“Maybe he wants to raise the kids’ skill levels?”</p><p>“Or else he’s trying to remove one of the rank divisions and kickstart some reform.”</p><p>The one-eyed woman’s expression turned sharp.</p><p>Whatever the “positive change” was, it wouldn’t be good news for them. The more dysfunctional and unjust the world was, the more recruits they gained. So anyone stirring up real improvement was an enemy. For villains, the world was best left as is.</p><p>“I don’t like it.”</p><p>“Neither do I, but what can we do?”</p><p>“We take them out. Starting with this ‘Baek Seojin,’ that piece on Ma Hakjun’s chessboard.”</p><p>“I’ve heard rumors he’s friendly with that crazy blonde.”</p><p>“Since when did we ever give a damn about that bitch?”</p><p>The big man cackled, acknowledging that was true.</p><p>“Besides, I hear she just took down a certain group or something.”</p><p>“Yes. Our people confirmed it.”</p><p>“We can say she took offense there, so we’re attacking his acquaintance out of revenge. They even plastered photos in the newspapers. Everyone knows we can’t touch her, so we go after her friend—that’s all there is to it.”</p><p>The one-eyed woman asked “How about that?” and the man nodded.</p><p>Let&#39;s goo!!! 1 (goals: 48 votes) more votes on NovelBin to reach the vote goals. 1 extra chapters will be unlocked if we reached the vote goals.</p><p>Happy reading!</p><p>If you enjoyed the novel, please leave a rating and review on NovelBin.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 44</h1><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>◎ Number Blocked</p><p>: 44 ( 44 / ??? )</p><p>No matter how often I look at it, that damned question mark never goes away.</p><p>Why did it show up here, of all places? At first, it clearly asked for 10. Once I hit that, it gave me a massive reward. So I was excited for the next milestone—maybe 50 or 100. But it’s just question marks.</p><p>‘What a letdown.’</p><p>Yesterday, I got the notification: “Your waiting period for the required total is over.”</p><p>I’d gone “Finally!” who knows how many times.</p><p>Just meeting the 10-person requirement gave me a huge reward. So how big would the next one be? I hurriedly activated the Third Eye, and… got this.</p><p>That old saying about high expectations leading to betrayal is dead-on.</p><p>Beep—</p><p>Still, I find the will to live again. Why? Because it’s 6:00 PM—closing time. From the moment I clocked in, I’ve been waiting for this.</p><p>Yes, the Silver-rank evaluations are super important. But given the choice, I’ll skip them in a heartbeat. Work is still work—doesn’t matter if it’s tough or easy, I’d rather go home.</p><p>‘So far, everything’s going smoothly enough, just as planned.’</p><p>I’m not dragging the entire Academy into the “Special Evaluations” at once. First, I’m focusing on re-evaluating the Silvers.</p><p>The problem is the conflict in my own mind.</p><p>I want to keep them stuck in Bronze for as long as possible. I also know I have to let them go eventually. Those two impulses keep clashing.</p><p>Anyway, I absolutely want to keep Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon around. Thanks to the “No Pain, No Gain” trait, it benefits everyone if they stay longer.</p><p>But it’s different for the others.</p><p>They don’t have “No Pain, No Gain.” And the Academy does need its Silver ranks back. Holding them all in Bronze indefinitely might do more harm than good.</p><p>‘No matter how much I Gatekeep, eventually some have to go back to their rightful level.’</p><p>I already made my decision: I’ll only let through those who are truly ready. I’m worried about the penalty, but I can’t keep stalling forever.</p><p>My justification for all this is basically sound. I’m giving Silvers a sense of urgency, pushing them to work harder. Once they reclaim Silver, they’ll have grown enough to possibly aim for Gold. Then even the Gold tier might feel the pressure—mission accomplished.</p><p>But for that to happen, at least someone has to succeed in rejoining Silver. Whether because they have real skill, high potential, or have shown consistent effort, someone needs to break out of Bronze and surpass the Gatekeeper.</p><p>‘Even though it’s a shame… I guess I’ll have to let go of the ones who no longer need to stay.’</p><p>Some of them only made it to Silver and then got complacent, never pushing further until it cost them their lives. I want to extend their lifespans, at least a little, and that’s my top priority. My own growth is just piggybacking on that goal.</p><p>…At least that’s the rational explanation, but I still feel sad about it. Letting them go means fewer motivated participants who keep showing up. The ones who break under pressure right away? They exist, sure. If only they remain, my growth will stall too.</p><p>“Phew…”</p><p>We have less than a year until the prophesied catastrophe. Hopefully, by the time it hits, they and I are both ready.</p><p>“Examiner.”</p><p>That sounded like Kim Suhyeon. I looked up to see her standing by the Academy’s main gate.</p><p>She was with a group of people whose every gesture screamed “professional bodyguard.”</p><p>“Suhy—er, going home, Ms. Kim Suhyeon?”</p><p>If I used casual speech here, those bodyguards might glare holes in me. So I switched to polite language, and her eyes went wide.</p><p>She must’ve wondered why I suddenly changed how I spoke. I’d better give some kind of excuse.</p><p>“I see you have bodyguards with you.”</p><p>“Oh—uh, yes…”</p><p>They probably don’t know about the arrangement with Kang Minseong. He dotes on his granddaughter, so if they see a random young man speaking informally to her, their reaction might not be friendly.</p><p>“Yes, even though I said it wasn’t necessary, Grandfather insisted…”</p><p>“That must be tiring for them.”</p><p>I greeted them with a little bow, but got no response.</p><p>Sharp suits with not a crease, sunglasses giving off a chilling vibe. It’s the same typical bodyguard look, even in a world full of rampaging monsters and villains.</p><p>At least they weren’t blocking me. That’s good.</p><p>Who knew that being associated with Irina, of all people, would come in handy?</p><p>“Umm, Examiner, do you, by chance, have plans for dinner?”</p><p>“Dinner? Not really. I was probably just going to eat at home.”</p><p>“O-oh, I see! So, if it’s alright… maybe we could eat together?”</p><p>Wait. Since when was Kim Suhyeon this forward?</p><p>TN: Since you made her deal with her insecurities duhh.. hahaha.</p><p>I glanced at the bodyguards. They were trying to act nonchalant, but they couldn’t hide their shock. Clearly, this was a first.</p><p>‘Refusing would probably just create more problems, right?’</p><p>She must have mustered serious courage to invite me like that. For someone as shy as her, that’s huge. The fact she managed to do it is great in itself.</p><p>On top of that, there’s nothing wrong with two adults sharing a meal. If she were a minor, I’d have immediate cause for alarm. But we’re both adults—no problems here.</p><p>“Sure, let’s do it. Honestly, I was just worrying about what to eat tonight.”</p><p>“R-really? Then let’s go! You can ride in this car!”</p><p>Hey, hey, Suhyeon, slow down. Why’re you opening the door for me like a chauffeur? Now the bodyguards are startled, trying to do it themselves.</p><p>Also, wow, the inside of this car is easily a hundred times nicer than my apartment. Then again, it belongs to Kang Minseong’s family, who are all massive heavyweights. So yeah, it makes sense.</p><p>‘Hmm…’</p><p>I wish Suhyeon would say something else. She asked me to have dinner, told me to get in the car, but now she’s just quietly sitting there. This is awkward.</p><p>Perhaps she picked up on my inner wish: “Um… do you have any preference for what to eat?”</p><p>“I’m good with anything. If you have somewhere in mind, let’s go there. I’m sure I won’t dislike it.”</p><p>“Really? But what if you end up not liking it…?”</p><p>“Never. I can eat anything.”</p><p>From veggies to fish to meat. It’s all fine. I learned in my old life—and here again—that refusing food is nonsense. Life’s a fight to eat; who can afford to be picky?</p><p>We rode along, watching the cityscape pass outside the window. I remembered it from riding buses and subways. Then, it had felt bleak, lonely. Now, traveling in a car worth a fortune, everything seemed beautiful. Maybe this is why people get obsessed with fancy cars.</p><p>‘Though personally, I’d rather just have three decent meals a day like a normal person.’</p><p>In any case, the city looked gorgeous.</p><p>At nightfall, brilliant lights lit the sky. People enjoying the sweet relief of finishing work—some alone, some together, each spending their evening. Maybe a shooting star overhead would add a dash of romance…</p><p>‘…Wait a second.’</p><p>Why was that “shooting star” not falling from the sky, but instead heading straight for us?</p><p>“Suhyeon!”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>BOOM—!!</p><p>A thunderous explosion and a burst of flame enveloped the entire area.</p><p>*</p><p>“Woohoo. Direct hit.”</p><p>A raging fireball slammed into the car, causing it to lurch and crash into a building. The one-eyed woman who’d unleashed the magic clapped the big, dark man on the back.</p><p>“We don’t have long. Superhumans will be here soon.”</p><p>“Relax. We already have unexpected guests, but it works in our favor.”</p><p>She held out a hand, and the big man handed her a massive axe.</p><p>“Let’s finish up and scram, before the crazy ones arrive.”</p><p>At that, the big man signaled with a gesture. Out of the shadows came a bunch of villains, stepping into the open.</p><p>“Boss.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>A subordinate scanning the area frowned slightly.</p><p>“It seems most of them survived.”</p><p>“Looks that way. Didn’t you cast that spell properly?”</p><p>“The car’s sturdier than expected, and those bodyguards aren’t normal humans.”</p><p>Sure enough, the vehicle—expected to be a burning wreck—remained largely intact, with bodyguards in front and back quickly forming a defensive line.</p><p>“They’re probably around B-rank. At least one is A-rank, maybe.”</p><p>“So what? Fighting them will slow us down.”</p><p>“I’ll keep them busy; you handle the target.”</p><p>“Might take a while, though.”</p><p>“Then be prepared to miss your drama.”</p><p>He joked about watching the rerun. The one-eyed woman snickered, nudging him with her axe.</p><p>“Should I slice them up?”</p><p>“…I’ll be back.”</p><p>“Sure thing.”</p><p>Gripping a wickedly sharp axe, the one-eyed woman dashed ahead.</p><p>If anyone asked why she was doing this, she’d say: “Why does there need to be a reason? I’m doing it because I feel like it.”</p><p>That’s the guiding principle for a villain. Nothing restrains their impulses.</p><p>If they want to cause mayhem, they do it. If they want to kill, they kill.</p><p>And tonight, her chosen target was that man stepping out of the wrecked car: Baek Seojin.</p>"

She’d been lying there in a daze, then suddenly sat bolt upright as if remembering something important.</p><p>“E-Examiner! Where’s the Examiner?!”</p><p>Her last memory was of him wrapping his arms around her. After that, she had no recollection—just an overwhelming impact and thunderous noise.</p><p>“Examiner… Examiner!”</p><p>Even though the bodyguards insisted she stay put, she broke free of their attempts to hold her back.</p><p>‘Could it be… because of me? Did something happen to him because of me?’</p><p>No way, that can’t be. He’s someone amazing. He’s definitely okay. …But what if he isn’t? If my worries are right…?</p><p>Is this yet another case of someone getting hurt—or worse—on my account? Someone leaving forever? No, she couldn’t bear the thought anymore. Please, no more. She just wanted it all to stop.</p><p>She swayed as she looked for Baek Seojin, who had vanished from sight—</p><p>“Look out!”</p><p>Almost at the same time as the other bodyguards’ warning, another fireball came hurtling toward them. Instantly, all the bodyguards around Kim Suhyeon jumped in front of her.</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>The blazing mass shattered, scattering embers and smoke in every direction. From within those flames and black haze, a figure emerged. Seeing it, Kim Suhyeon—and even the bodyguards—were taken aback.</p><p>“That was a close call.”</p><p>He was clutching the door of the very car they had been riding in, using it as a makeshift shield. How he’d managed to tear it off was unclear, but it was obvious the vehicle’s sturdy build was now being used to block magic attacks.</p><p>“Examiner! Are… are you hurt anywhere?”</p><p>“I’m okay. How about you, Suhyeon—are you alright?”</p><p>At that, Kim Suhyeon nodded. She felt overwhelmingly grateful that even in a moment like this, he was worrying about her.</p><p>“Miss, you need to get out of here! If you follow the route behind us—”</p><p>“No, bodyguards, please don’t move.”</p><p>Taken aback by Baek Seojin’s abrupt order, Kim Suhyeon immediately fell still as well.</p><p>“What do you mean? Miss Kim’s safety is—”</p><p>“If you try to escape into the crowd, what about the people there?”</p><p>Hearing that, the bodyguards glanced around and fell silent.</p><p>He was right: the only real escape route was into the crowd of civilians. But that would cause horrific collateral damage if the enemy decided to pursue them. Even if their priority was protecting their charge, they couldn’t bring themselves to endanger so many bystanders.</p><p>“It’s better if we hold our ground here.”</p><p>“But if something goes wrong—!”</p><p>“Also, who’s to say there aren’t more villains hiding among the civilians?”</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>“And can you truly guarantee you’ll be able to protect her in that chaos where you can’t even tell friend from foe?”</p><p>In response to that calm but pointed logic, the bodyguards finally complied. They formed up around Kim Suhyeon, watching for villains trying to break through.</p><p>“Aah…”</p><p>Only then did Kim Suhyeon fully register what was happening. Like the Academy attack before, villains were swarming again from all sides. She remembered how they’d indiscriminately hurt students and faculty, all while searching for her.</p><p>“A-ahh!! N-no… no!”</p><p>She felt the terror of the Elder returning in full force.</p><p>She didn’t know whether these were Elders or not. It didn’t matter. The nightmares from last time devoured her thoughts, every step turning her legs to jelly. The screams echoing around them stabbed at her psyche.</p><p>Even when the bodyguards tried to console her—saying it was okay, that there were plenty of people here to defend her—she wouldn’t calm down.</p><p>“Haahk! Hhk! Ugh…!”</p><p>She began to hyperventilate, her condition only worsening by the second.</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>A voice spoke from up ahead. She recognized it as Baek Seojin. When Kim Suhyeon lifted her gaze, he was calling out to her:</p><p>“Suhyeon?”</p><p>“Y-yes… E-Examiner…!”</p><p>“Don’t worry. Like last time, I’ll handle everything.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Then think of this as just another test.”</p><p>“A test?”</p><p>She repeated the word questioningly, and Baek Seojin offered a small smile.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m the ‘Examiner,’ right? Where you’re standing behind me is the place you call ‘Silver,’ and I’m here to stop any ‘students’ who want to get there. Doesn’t that make you feel better? I mean, have you ever seen any student make it to Silver yet?”</p><p>“…No. Not one.”</p><p>“Exactly. Today won’t be any different.”</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>Another magic blast came crashing in, and once again, Baek Seojin blocked it head-on. He rolled his shoulders, preparing himself.</p><p>He had wondered why things had been so quiet lately.</p><p>He sure hadn’t expected to be working overtime here.</p><p>The moment he tried to head home, trouble found him—such was the fate of a low-ranking public servant.</p><p>He batted aside yet another fireball, scattering bright sparks. The battered car door in his grip proved its worth once more.</p><p>‘Are they targeting Kim Suhyeon again? That’s likely.’</p><p>He took a moment to survey the area.</p><p>Last time, the Elder showed up to abduct Kim Suhyeon personally. If it happened again, that might be the end, because neither Han Jiyoon nor Ma Hakjun was here to help hold them off.</p><p>‘Could I handle an Elder now…? Probably not.’</p><p>He imagined the outcomes. All of them ended in defeat. Right now, he’d barely manage an A-rank if he went all out.</p><p>So, he stayed alert, carefully checking for any sign of an Elder. Thankfully, he didn’t feel that terrifying, needle-like sensation from last time.</p><p>No, these guys—led by that one-eyed woman and the big man—were likely the strongest ones here. They were formidable, maybe B-rank or even A-rank, but at least they weren’t Elders.</p><p>‘It’s not ideal, but it’s a relief there’s no Elder involved.’</p><p>A-ranks aren’t pushovers. Still, they’re more manageable than Elders.</p><p>“That axe-wielding maniac again,” muttered the bodyguard leader, stepping forward. He, too, was no slouch, likely the top fighter among the guards.</p><p>“Please excuse me,” he said, addressing Baek Seojin. “I saw your news coverage. You must be quite skilled.”</p><p>“Nah, I’m just a public servant drowning in overwork.”</p><p>“You say that, but the way you use that door as a shield is no joke.”</p><p>“Desperation makes you creative,” Baek Seojin joked lightly.</p><p>“Anyway, I have one more request, even though we owe you so much.”</p><p>“You want me to stay here while you go after that one-eyed woman?”</p><p>The man nodded slowly.</p><p>“We just need you to hold out until reinforcements come. A few more minutes. Please.”</p><p>“An unexpected bit of overtime, huh? Not like you’re paying my salary,” he grumbled.</p><p>“We’ll repay this debt someday. I beg you.”</p><p>At his nod, the bodyguard leader smiled, shouting, “Hey, you crazy axe freak!” as he charged forward. Off in the distance, the one-eyed woman retorted, “What the—thought I killed you already? Damn musclehead?” Obviously they had a history.</p><p>‘Which leaves the rest of us to handle the smaller fry…’</p><p>The lesser villains advanced on Kim Suhyeon’s group, with that big, dark man in the lead. Baek Seojin eyed him warily.</p><p>Boom—</p><p>Again, the man conjured a massive fireball in his hand. He was definitely a magic-type user, yet from his physique, it was clear he was no fragile spellcaster.</p><p>“You should die.”</p><p>So, he was ignoring everything else, only focusing on finishing them off. Probably he intended to kill Kim Suhyeon now that kidnapping her was impossible. If it meant preventing her from becoming a future threat, he’d do it.</p><p>‘Not on my watch. She’s no longer fated to be that dreaded villain.’</p><p>She’d be a major ally in the coming catastrophe. They’d saved her from the Elder, so letting her fall to a B-rank baddie now would be insane.</p><p>“Don’t spout nonsense, you damn villain.”</p><p>He tried to taunt the man, but got no reaction. The big man clearly wasn’t interested in him, just in finishing off Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>No chance.

            "title": "Chapter 46",
            "body": "<h1>Chapter 46</h1><p>“Here’s the target.”</p><p>The shady man handed out a photo to his subordinates, who nodded in unison. It was that guy from the recent news broadcasts, right? Baek Seojin.</p><p>Why kill random people? Why plunge the world into chaos? To a group of villains, such questions were laughable.</p><p>Maybe they just found it amusing to watch society crumble further. Or maybe seeing people in agony excited them.</p><p>Whatever the reason, if they wanted to do it, they did it. They weren’t bound by law, ethics, or morals. The only things that mattered in their world were power and orders.</p><p>“After we finish him, we’ll leave some traces behind so we can pin the blame on someone else.”</p><p>In the underworld, villains had far more extensive networks than legitimate superhumans. That’s how they’d found out about a certain plot to target Baek Seojin. They planned to turn that knowledge to their advantage.</p><p>The plan: pretend they were a contract-killer group hired by the ones who originally wanted him gone. That plan having failed, they stepped in to finish the job.</p><p>So, they picked today to strike. But the situation they encountered was unexpected.</p><p>“There are bodyguards. And he’s with a woman.”</p><p>“Apparently she’s Kim Suhyeon, a first-year at the Academy, granddaughter of Kang Minseong.”</p><p>The dark man felt the plan was getting complicated. He had only prepared for Baek Seojin alone. Now there was an extra party.</p><p>He hesitated, considering pulling back and waiting for another chance, but his boss—the one-eyed woman—just laughed at the idea.</p><p>“Then we do it today.”</p><p>That was all. If that was her command, it meant they’d strike now. The bodyguards wouldn’t matter. They’d handle it.</p><p>Sure enough, the man used a magic attack to flip the target’s car, causing chaos. Their hidden subordinates revealed themselves. They had to wrap everything up within ten minutes, before superhuman reinforcements arrived.</p><p>‘It’s not too hard.’</p><p>Yes, there were bodyguards, but their top priority was protecting the principal. A few might help Baek Seojin, but the rest of the villains were also in play.</p><p>Though their top fighter (the woman’s “Boss”) was busy elsewhere, the dark man himself was near A-rank. Even as a magic-type, he had monstrous physical prowess.</p><p>‘We’ll quickly corner him, finish him, then get out.’</p><p>He openly flaunted his magic in front so they’d see him as a threat that must be neutralized first. Meanwhile, the rest of his group would circle around behind.</p><p>All they had to do was corner Baek Seojin. The man was rumored to be around B-rank, well within reason for them.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>“Grrk!”</p><p>But every time his men tried to slip behind, their infiltration got wrecked. The moment they approached from the rear, Baek Seojin flicked his attention that way, taking them out. And each time, it was scarily accurate.</p><p>He himself kept up the pressure so Baek Seojin wouldn’t notice the flank. But ironically, Baek Seojin was handling all of it with uncanny precision. Even though the big man threw magic at him, feigning openings, Baek Seojin would suddenly slip away and ambush the guys sneaking around.</p><p>‘…I guess Irina didn’t treasure him for nothing.’</p><p>He was far from easy prey. His combat sense was extraordinary.</p><p>He was fully engaged in the fight yet never forgot to watch his back. Usually, even a skilled fighter’s performance plummets once surrounded. But he managed to shatter every attempt at encirclement with perfect timing.</p><p>They might have badly underestimated him by labeling him a B-rank. If he was given time, he could become a big name. Killing him early was definitely a wise move.</p><p>So, thinking that, the big man lunged at Baek Seojin once more.</p><p>*</p><p>‘They’re definitely after Kim Suhyeon, just like I thought.’</p><p>Yes, their plan was to finish what the Elder left undone: target Kim Suhyeon. That explained why they kept trying to flank me and break through behind.</p><p>Some of the bodyguards had broken formation to cover my blind spots, and their leader was busy with the one-eyed woman. That left a window for them to slip through.</p><p>‘Too bad. I won’t give them the chance.’</p><p>It’s not like my field of vision is blocked. They can’t force me to leave an opening. If we can’t move to a more favorable location, I’ll just keep smashing their flanking maneuvers.</p><p>As soon as I sense them forming a “wing,” I break it. No point letting them set up a “pincer.”</p><p>‘Now…!’</p><p>After blocking the man’s magic, I grabbed a shard of debris from the surroundings and hurled it at the one about to jump Kim Suhyeon from behind.</p><p>Dude, if you’re gonna pretend to be a civilian, at least do it properly. No rational bystander just stands around casually while villains attack.</p><p>Crack—!</p><p>“Guhk!”</p><p>Sounded like a melon or a gourd splitting. I didn’t care about whether his skull was fine—what mattered was that Kim Suhyeon was safe. Let the bodyguards or paramedics handle the rest.</p><p>“Impressive,” muttered the big man, stepping closer again.</p><p>He was a magic-type but proficient in close combat, too—a muscle wizard, basically. Good grief.</p><p>“Time is short. I’ll end this now.”</p><p>A polite tone from a villain—how strange. But that’s the gist of it: he planned to finish me quickly, then kill Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>It wasn’t going to happen. The Gatekeeper was wide awake, buddy.</p><p>Yes, he was obviously an experienced criminal. By normal standards, an A-rank is formidable.</p><p>But I felt confident.</p><p>Starting with the Elder Kwak Hyuk, then sparring with Ma Hakjun, and facing guys like Lee Hyunwoo, Kim Suhyeon, and even that arrogant Jung Yuhyeon. In each fight, I gleaned lessons from every single one.</p><p>With each clash, I memorized how they fought. I took their strengths for myself and learned from their weaknesses, imprinting them so I wouldn’t make the same mistakes.</p><p>Perhaps that’s another hidden quirk of the Gatekeeper Trait—learning from each adversary. I couldn’t think of another explanation for my rapid improvement.</p><p>“Hup!”</p><p>Once again, the big man conjured a massive ball of flame, but this time he actually grabbed it and charged forward?</p><p>‘Is he insane? A magic-type user carrying a fireball right into close range…?’</p><p>That’s like loading a gun then sprinting into a knife fight. Usually, you want to exploit your advantage from a distance.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, I’d dodge. My improvised shield—the car door—was no longer at my side.</p><p>But that might be exactly what he wants. The moment I leap aside, he could slip past me to Kim Suhyeon, or coordinate with an ally.</p><p>‘If I preserve my piece, I might lose my king. I can’t let that happen.’</p><p>So I must not dodge. I have to block. Even if it means my body ends up roasted. But it didn’t feel impossible. If I had survived the Elder’s assault, then…</p><p>I locked eyes on the big man’s approach. I watched the flicker of determination in his gaze. Everything about him. I realized this moment would also become part of my ever-expanding experience.</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>What happened next was a blur. Something flashed before my eyes, and my first coherent thought was:</p><p>‘It’s hot!!’</p><p>Like splashing myself with scalding water from a cooler. My arms burned, quickly followed by a stinging pain. I recall times when I got mild burns that took days to recover. The memory made me wince.</p><p>Glancing around, I saw the big man slump to the ground in the direction he’d been rushing from.</p><p>It looked like the bodyguards had successfully handled the other flank. Good. So we survived.</p><p>“I’m alive. That’s what matters most.”</p><p>Under normal logic, those flames should have inflicted severe burns. But awakened superhumans have boosted physical resilience. Good job, character creation.</p><p>And with the immediate threat to Kim Suhyeon gone…</p><p>◎ Notification</p><p>A seed has been planted.</p><p>Planted Seed – Affection`</p><p>…Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?</p><p>There’s only one person who could trigger a message like that. I looked behind me to where Kim Suhyeon crouched.</p><p>◎ Notification</p><p>At least three seeds have been planted.</p><p>Conditions met.</p><p>Changing Kim Suhyeon’s Trait from “Genius Consumed by Inferiority.”`</p><p>So her Trait is finally changing, ditching that “inferiority”? Perfect. My heartfelt wish was for Suhyeon to ascend to a level on par with Lee Hyunwoo!</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>Crimson Witch</p><p>…What the hell?</p><p>TN: Maybe it&#39;s a lawful good Crimson Witch instead of chaotic evil Crimson Witch hahaha.</p><p>Yuyu: Hahaha, We can only hope.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 47</h1><p>Because the bodyguards absolutely couldn’t abandon Suhyeon, it fell to Baek Seojin to push forward, engaging the villains’ top fighters in a grueling battle.</p><p>During the fight, he suddenly swiveled at times, throwing something that knocked down several “civilians.” Those turned out to be disguised members of the villain gang.</p><p>Thanks to him, the load on the bodyguards guarding Kim Suhyeon was massively reduced. He was facing more than half the villains alone, and dealing with the rest behind the scenes as well.</p><p>In other words, though some bodyguards provided backup, Baek Seojin was effectively holding back the bulk of the assault all by himself.</p><p>“Should we join him?”</p><p>“No. That Examiner is way above our level. If we butt in, we’ll just hamper him. Our best move is to stay here and keep him free to fight without distraction.”</p><p>So they just handled the ones trying to slip past him. Meanwhile, Baek Seojin stopped every frontal attack.</p><p>“….”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon crouched among the bodyguards, watching silently.</p><p>How can he manage all that? He had no obligation to do so. He had no real reason to risk himself for them. He was just a regular person. Yet here he was, fighting to protect her.</p><p>She truly was grateful. She wanted to repay him someday.</p><p>So that time he got hurt fighting Jung Yuhyeon, or she saw blood on his side, she’d been furious.</p><p>And he was the one who showed her how much she mattered. Told her not to compare herself to others. That she could accept herself as she was and move forward at her own pace.</p><p>From that moment on, Kim Suhyeon found herself admiring—maybe even adoring—Examiner Baek Seojin.</p><p>And now, with villains assaulting them yet again, exactly like the time the Elder invaded the Academy, he stood before her and shielded her once more.</p><p>At that sight, she realized she was beginning to cherish him deeply.</p><p>‘He’s over there, fighting alone to protect me…’</p><p>Boom—!</p><p>Once again, Baek Seojin blocked the man’s flame-laced magic head-on. The blazing embers scattered with a roar, black smoke rising all around. Even at this distance, the heat was palpable.</p><p>It must be excruciating for him. Those flames must hurt him terribly. Kim Suhyeon felt a surge of anger. She also felt a longing to become someone like him.</p><p>‘I can do it, too. I can fight for him!’</p><p>She burned with fury at her protector’s suffering, and also yearned to step up for his sake. Fueled by those powerful emotions, the seeds inside her started to sprout.</p><p>Ssshhh—</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s irises began turning red. Not from bloodshot scleras, but rather her pupils themselves.</p><p>Her deep-seated inferiority and self-doubt still lingered, but the seeds had taken root, sprouted, and grown. And now, at last, they bloomed, unstoppable.</p><p>“Reinforcements will arrive in one minute. We can almost— Miss?”</p><p>“M-Miss! What’s wrong? Why are you—hey, put the sword dow—?”</p><p>Ignoring their alarmed shouts, Kim Suhyeon calmly reached for a bodyguard’s sword.</p><p>Srrng—</p><p>It was a clear, ringing sound, the blade shining bright. Yet around that blade, a faint red glow started swirling.</p><p>“Miss!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, everyone. Really sorry. But… I need to go for just a moment.”</p><p>“Miss! That’s too dangerous. Please step back and—”</p><p>“The Examiner’s out there fighting alone. I’m sorry. I have no choice.”</p><p>Her voice was as timid and small as ever. Still, none of them dared to stop her now.</p><p>Their awakened superhuman senses screamed at them: the best move was to back away while she was still in a friendly mood.</p><p>‘I see more burns… he’s hurt again…’</p><p>Baek Seojin’s arm was covered with red-and-brown burn marks. Seeing them, Kim Suhyeon frowned as though she had been the one who got hurt.</p><p>She was angry. The person she admired, the one she cherished, was injured. She wanted to get rid of that dark-clad man who caused it, by her own hand this time. She wanted to move one step closer to being like Baek Seojin.</p><p>Her footsteps felt so light. The sword in her hand felt wonderful. She could see exactly where to slash, where to stab, and how to make him suffer the most. It was all perfectly clear in her eyes.</p><p>“What the…?”</p><p>The dark-clad man had finally managed to stand up, but he recoiled in shock and staggered backward.</p><p>Splurt―!</p><p>A deep sword-cut was already carved into his chest.</p><p>*</p><p>I did not see it. I had no idea how Kim Suhyeon moved just now. I did not see how she swung her sword or from which direction. My mind might have been distracted by the words “Crimson Witch” that had just appeared. That might be why. Still, even so, this was beyond anything I expected.</p><p>“Urgh…”</p><p>That dark villain, who had been fighting so well, just toppled backwards. He was not quite dead, but blood kept oozing from the gaping wound. If her blade had gone in a bit deeper, I wondered whether we would be looking at a man sliced in two.</p><p>“Reinforcements are here! Retreat!”</p><p>“Boss! Our backup arrived!”</p><p>“Damn it! Hey, grab him and run!”</p><p>Almost at once, one of the villains dashed over and scooped up the dark-clad man. Kim Suhyeon tried slashing immediately, but the enemy moved faster. He did not look especially strong, so he must have had speed-focused powers.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>The bodyguard leader, who had been fighting the one-eyed woman, roared. However, they already had too much distance, and chasing someone who was bent on escaping was not easy.</p><p>They also were not there to arrest villains. If they chased carelessly, they might incur even more risk. Letting them go was a rational choice.</p><p>“Examiner. Shall we go after them?”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon looked straight at me and asked that. Moments ago, she had been trembling in fear, but there was no sign of that now. I sensed she was ready to hunt them all down if I gave the word.</p><p>‘What on earth just happened to her?’</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Notification</p><p>All seeds needed for her awakening have now sprouted.</p><p>All the penalties from her previous Trait have vanished.</p><p>◎ Kim Suhyeon</p><p>Crimson Witch</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>A being who has now fully awakened to the blood-soaked battlefield.</p><p>She grows stronger whenever she sees blood.</p><p>The clearer her intent to kill becomes, the longer she remains in a hyper-aware state.</p><p>Wounds no longer weaken her.</p><p>As long as someone is there to guide her, she will not break.</p><p>- Currently in early-awakened form.</p><p>- The Trait can grow further.</p><p>- A sub-trait has manifested.</p><p>◎ Sub-Trait</p><p>Berserk</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>When emotional stress hits a threshold, all combat abilities surge.</p><p>Normally, one would fail to distinguish friend from foe, but “Crimson Witch” keeps that under control.</p><p>She can use “Berserk” without losing her mind.</p><p>This was pure shock and fear.</p><p>Her new Trait was literally called the Crimson Witch. That future I  had tried so hard to avoid had come back again.</p><p>The description was brutal too. She grew stronger the more blood she saw, and the clearer her intent to kill, the longer she stayed at peak awareness.</p><p>‘It’s on the same broken level as Lee Hyunwoo.’</p><p>A single slash that sliced through her foe without the slightest hesitation. Speed, precision, power—there were no weak points. This was the early stage of her awakening, and it might evolve further. No wonder the protagonist had such trouble with the Crimson Witch in the original timeline.</p><p>And her Sub-Trait? Berserk. This alone sounded terrifying enough, but:</p><p>The biggest drawback to berserker-type powers is losing the ability to distinguish friend from foe. They fall into bloodlust and kill indiscriminately. That is the fate of anyone who goes berserk.</p><p>This “Crimson Witch” Trait neatly countered that drawback, letting her remain fully sane. So, basically, she had a godlike buff skill without any penalty.</p><p>She really did get that big “power up” I was hoping for. Yes, she soared to a mind-blowing level, but I felt terribly uneasy about it.</p><p>“…You’re hurt again.”</p><p>At some point, Kim Suhyeon had sidled up close to me, gently touching my injured arm. She did not seem to care that the villains were fleeing or that the bodyguards were asking if she was alright. She only had eyes for the burns on my skin.</p><p>I recalled the Crimson Witch from the original story, the monstrous villain who fought Lee Hyunwoo to a standstill. That same woman who dragged hundreds of thousands of lives into the depths during the assault on Seoul.</p><p>And here she was, a student at the Academy, gazing at me with a look of distress in her eyes.</p><p>“This? It’s no big deal, Suhyeon. Like I said, just a little scald from some hot water.”</p><p>“But it really must hurt. Am I wrong?”</p><p>Well, yes. It did hurt. Burns always hurt. Everyone knows they are one of the most painful injuries a body can sustain.</p><p>But was it worth getting that anxious over? In all honesty, it felt more like a quick grease burn from cooking. Nothing that serious.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Examiner. I’ll try harder.”</p><p>I was pretty sure she meant it in the sense of working harder at her training, so she could do better in her evaluations and become stronger. Ordinarily, that would feel wonderful to hear from a student. It should have made me proud.</p><p>‘So then… why does it sound like she means “I’ll get better at killing them next time?”’</p><p>I could only hope that was my imagination. Yes, please, let it be my imagination.</p><p>Yuyu: Sorry bro, but in this, you&#39;re out of luck.</p>"

Irina’s secretary had simple wishes like that.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>However, that woman did not allow either running or fainting.</p><p>He could not do it. He could not lose consciousness or leave his seat. Gazing at that terrifying look in her eyes, he found himself unable to do anything at all.</p><p>He almost wished she would beat him, the way she did to villains. The pain in his body might have been severe, but at least his mind would be more at ease.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Irina rose from her chair and came closer with determined steps.

Whenever a person who usually spoke casually suddenly used honorifics, it meant Irina was truly upset.</p><p>“Just now. What did you say?”</p><p>He needed to answer. That was the only way to survive, yet his mouth would not open because of fear.</p><p>He worried that he would be crushed on the spot if he said the wrong thing, or vanish without a trace. The possibilities stuck to him like tar and kept his lips shut.</p><p>Would an ordinary superhuman do such a thing? Maybe not. But this was Irina. The crazy blonde. The Association barely managed to rein her in. If not for that, she would have gone around ripping villains to shreds. And if someone annoyed her, she could turn on them just as easily, even if they were not villains.</p><p>Her recent stomp on the Jinhan Group was a prime example. She suddenly talked about creeping into back alleys, and though the secretary tried to stop her, she brought back random men she caught somewhere and was livid with rage. The next day, she marched into Jinhan Group and caused an uproar.</p><p>The secretary had no idea what triggered her anger this time.</p><p>He was called a “secretary,” but in truth, he acted as a messenger who reported her movements to the Association. He tried to calm her down when she seemed about to lose control. Those tasks were the extent of his job.</p><p>One thing was certain. The Jinhan name had nearly been wiped from the world. The man was not talking about forced takeovers or abrupt liquidation. Irina was ready to remove them physically, leaving no traces behind.</p><p>“S-some… villains caused chaos in the heart of the city… and, and….”</p><p>“And? Do not stop there.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. Kim Suhyeon, the granddaughter of Kang Minseong, happened to be there….”</p><p>“When did I ask about that? About that old man’s granddaughter living or dying? That is not what I asked.”</p><p>Sssss―</p><p>Irina’s unrestrained powers made the air around her burn. Or maybe she was not even trying to restrain herself. The enormous pressure crushed the secretary’s entire being. It was the raw, primal fear of standing before an overwhelmingly powerful foe. He wanted to speak, but the words stuck in his throat.</p><p>“Th-that Examiner you met before… named Baek Seojin, was there as well….”</p><p>Driven by the need to survive, he overcame his fear enough to finish his words.</p><p>“….”</p><p>Irina said nothing. Not a single word.</p><p>Given her habit of blurting out whatever she felt, this was shocking. People joked in the Association that “Irina not talking is as good as Irina being dead.” The secretary found it horrifying to see her go completely silent.</p><p>“…They touched him. My handsome oppa.”</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Irina finally spoke, murmuring those words in a quiet voice.</p><p>“They messed with someone I already marked as mine.”</p><p>“M-Miss Irina?”</p><p>“Some random fools tried to scuff him up earlier, which annoyed me, but now the villain rats are getting involved?”</p><p>She let out a snort and suddenly whirled around, walking away with heavy footsteps.</p><p>“Miss Irina! Where are you going!?”</p><p>“Gonna smash the ones who wrecked my stuff.”</p><p>“What? Ah, no! Please hold on! If you just leave right now, then what about…?”</p><p>They were not in South Korea. Irina and her secretary were in a certain Russian port city.</p><p>Reports had surfaced that certain Russian-flagged vessels were sneaking drugs into other countries, so top officials arranged a joint investigation between nations. Normally, Russian and Korean agencies would handle it, but some problems arose.</p><p>A few of these drug syndicates were rumored to include villains, and that area was considered an unofficial territory of one of the Elders. Ordinary investigators would be in danger. On top of that, there were issues with the Russian side’s internal situation.</p><p>“Currently, most of our S-rank superhumans are dealing with a giant Gate near Saint Petersburg. We only have one available, so if the Korean side can send support, our government will be very grateful.”</p><p>That meant they wanted an S-rank superhuman from Korea. Korea agreed, and the Association sent a team of staff and an S-rank bodyguard. That was Irina.</p><p>She had actually volunteered to go. She was bored and thought it might be fun, especially if an Elder turned up. Normally she detested bodyguard work, but this time she claimed she would enjoy it.</p><p>“…So that fat pig is scaring them, huh.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“He only gropes women, so what is there to fear? If I stop him from showing up, I am done. Then they can do whatever they want, yeah?”</p><p>When Irina asked that, the secretary instinctively nodded without thinking. If someone had watched from the future, they would have screamed that the secretary should not have done that or told her such a thing.</p><p>“Miss Irina? Where are you going?”</p><p>“To clear away the problem.”</p><p>She said so, then turned and lightly kicked off the ground. In a blink, she became a gold streak soaring beyond the sky.</p><p>Before long, there was a massive explosion far away.</p><p>It was the fight between an S-rank superhuman, Irina, and the Elder named Aleksei, known to some as a half-god or demigod.</p><p>“What the hell, why is that crazy woman picking a fight with me?!”</p><p>The Elder never intended to get involved, yet got blindsided anyway.</p><p>*</p><p>[Our next update: The government, in a joint investigation with Russian authorities, has successfully dismantled an overseas organization that was smuggling drugs. The Russian government has expressed immense gratitude for our country’s assistance….]</p><p>Wicked scum. If they want to do drugs, they should keep it in their own country. Why haul it here?</p><p>“They are terrible, all right. They tried to sneak narcotics into drug-free Korea.”</p><p>Since earlier, Kang Hana had been next to me, chattering away.</p><p>She was the student council president. I was just a government employee. Yet she was there, striking up a cheerful conversation as if there was nothing else to do.</p><p>“That is true. But it does not actually involve me personally. They will handle it themselves.”</p><p>Yes, it was not my department. If anything, it was beneficial for us that we owed Russia a favor. Or maybe they owed us. Whichever the case, I was not directly involved.</p><p>“Uh, by the way. Kang Hana. Aren’t you going to class?”</p><p>“Today is a free day. You don’t have to worry.”</p><p>“Then what about the student council work?”</p><p>“It was all done in the morning. There wasn’t anything special on the agenda.”</p><p>I wanted her to go away, but she was not budging.</p><p>“I read that article a few days ago: ‘A public servant who stopped the Gate crisis, now battles villains to protect the city!’”</p><p>“It was not really a big fight. I just traded a few blows, that is all.”</p><p>“But witnesses say otherwise. They claim you handled everything, Examiner.”</p><p>It was impossible not to notice the sparkly look in Kang Hana’s eyes. She wanted something. She kept glancing at me, but she did not say it outright. She was feeling out my reactions.</p><p>‘Maybe it is about the Silver rank evaluations? Possibly she wants to address some student concerns.’</p><p>The synergy of Ma Hakjun’s support, plus my rhetorical appeals to the Silvers, had caused positive changes. Yet there were definitely some who disliked the new system.</p><p>I remember thinking more than once:</p><p>“You really amaze me every time I see you.”</p><p>But Kang Hana showed no signs of that whatsoever. At this point, I was starting to wonder if she just had nothing better to do—if she was coming here simply out of boredom.</p><p>“Examiner!”</p><p>Off in the distance, Kim Suhyeon comes running over with a bright smile.</p><p>She was no longer “the genius consumed by inferiority.” Instead, she had awakened as the “Crimson Witch.” That was not ideal, but at least she had escaped her previous crippling Trait. Also, it had not happened through villainous brainwashing. There was some relief in that, though I was still worried.</p><p>‘We must live with it now. Maybe it was her fate to become the Crimson Witch, and the question was how.’</p><p>“Oh, Suhyeon!”</p><p>Kang Hana, who was standing next to me, waved when she saw Kim Suhyeon running over.</p><p>I’d learned earlier during our small talk that the two of them knew each other. Apparently, they used to call each other &quot;sister&quot; so they must’ve been pretty close.</p><p>“Senpai, what are you doing here…?”</p><p>“I was just having a quick chat with the examiner. Are you feeling better now?”</p><p>“Ah… yes. Thank you for your concern.”</p><p>For reference, Kim Suhyeon had been forced to take two days off by Kang Minseong. He’d said she was probably pretty shaken and absolutely needed rest to recover mentally and physically.</p><p>When Ma Hakjun heard about it, he grumbled, ‘The doctor says she’s fine, so why is he the one making such a fuss? Seriously, just strip him of that “hero” title already.’</p><p>“I’m so glad. Really.”</p><p>Kang Hana pulled Kim Suhyeon into a gentle hug with a bright smile. From that alone, it looked like a touching moment between affectionate sisters…</p><p>So why did her face suddenly go stiff?</p><p>Come on, Suhyeon. Smile a little. You’re scaring me.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 49</h1><p>“…Oh, so Irina ended up going to Russia as well?”</p><p>“Yes. That’s the news I heard from Grandpa.”</p><p>After the brief greeting with Kang Hana, Kim Suhyeon suddenly mentioned it. The media never covered it, but it seemed Irina was among those dispatched to Russia. Kim Suhyeon explained that she crossed over and took part in the mission.</p><p>“Then why is there no mention of Irina on the news?”</p><p>An S-rank ability user drew attention anywhere in the world. They were strong enough to be considered true superheroes who saved people from monsters and villains. They had fans and supporters, and some were even treated like idols.</p><p>Irina was one of the top S-rank ability users. There were only about three people across the globe who could fight her on equal footing.</p><p>Later on, that number would be four if Lee Hyunwoo joined them. Now that Kim Suhyeon was one, perhaps the total became five.</p><p>That was why her popularity was enormous. She caused a fair share of controversy because she acted a bit outlandish.</p><p>“That’s strange, Suhyeon? This is the first I’ve heard of it. Even the Tower of Magic had no idea.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon kept her eyes on me, as though she did not hear Kang Hana’s question.</p><p>“It seems she clashed with the Elder in Russia in a full-scale battle.”</p><p>“…Huh?”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>I was not the only one shocked. Kang Hana leaped from her seat, eyes wide.</p><p>An S-rank ability user and an Elder were both living strategic weapons, acknowledged as the strongest. When either of them fought, the surrounding area became a wasteland.</p><p>Villains did not care how others judged them, but most S-rank ability users acted from a sense of duty. They rarely did anything that caused large-scale casualties.</p><p>“Most” was the key word.</p><p>“Was the damage severe? Considering what she’s like, it might have been brutal.”</p><p>Although Kang Hana asked, Kim Suhyeon remained quiet. She stared at me and blinked. After I repeated the question for her, she finally answered.</p><p>“Apparently there weren’t any towns or villages nearby, so they were lucky.”</p><p>“That’s a relief. A huge relief.”</p><p>Would Irina worry about diplomatic relations between Korea and other countries? She was the type to blow everything to pieces if something annoyed her, then laugh about it. If another country criticized Korea, she might even wreak havoc on that country.</p><p>It was not something that had happened yet, but part of the original story came to mind. Lee Hyunwoo had clashed with a Chinese ability user, prompting strong protests from the Chinese side. Irina, who was curious about his power, caught wind of that and caused chaos along China’s coast while claiming to hunt villains.</p><p>That was why people, villains and ability users alike, believed she was crazy. She seemed normal for a while, then lost control out of nowhere. Her mood swings left everyone unsettled.</p><p>The scariest part was that there was nothing wrong with her mind. She did it all in full clarity.</p><p>“That’s why I said you’re incredible, Examiner.”</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“Examiner, do you know one of the nicknames the villains gave Irina?”</p><p>Kang Hana’s question made me nod.</p><p>“I’ve heard of it. I assumed it was just a malicious label from the villains.”</p><p>“Half of them use it maliciously, but the other half use it for real.”</p><p>Even villains, along with the Elder himself, acknowledged that crazy blonde nickname. If that was how far it went, others in the world must have heard it too.</p><p>“She’s very eccentric. People say she almost never treats anyone kindly. Maybe other S-rank ability users, although sometimes she ends up picking fights with them.”</p><p>“She does sound a bit unhinged.”</p><p>I agreed, and Kang Hana smiled as if asking if I felt the same.</p><p>“She’s the same in front of reporters and cameras. If someone bothers her, she tells them to take the idiot and get lost. Her pride is monstrous, and she does not care about anyone. It’s a terrible combination.”</p><p>“It does sound extreme.”</p><p>“Yes. Such a person randomly shook hands with Examiner Baek Seojin and claimed you helped her deal with that monster. Everyone is watching you for that.”</p><p>She then quickly added that there was more to it than just Irina, as if worried I would think I only got attention for being acquainted with Irina.</p><p>“Anyway, Examiner. My point is…”</p><p>“Senior.”</p><p>Right before she finished, Kim Suhyeon quietly touched Kang Hana’s shoulder.</p><p>“Don’t you have a lecture today?”</p><p>“Huh? Oh, actually, I’m free.”</p><p>“You have no classes today.”</p><p>She stared at Kang Hana, who forced a nervous laugh. My heart skipped for a moment. Imagining the Crimson Witch wearing that expression made me feel dizzy.</p><p>They insisted they were close friends, but this gave me doubts.</p><p>Could Kang Hana be misunderstanding that closeness? She did not seem the type to miss obvious signals, so I was not sure.</p><p>“Ahem. Examiner, if it’s all right, I have a small suggestion I’d like to make.”</p><p>“A suggestion?”</p><p>“Yes. I do not want to pressure you in any way. It is just an idea, so please do not feel burdened.”</p><p>That might have made it more burdensome, but I still nodded.</p><p>“Are you familiar with the Tower of Magic clan, Examiner?”</p><p>“The Tower of Magic? Of course I know it. It’s well known.”</p><p>It was one of the top clans in Korea, well respected in society. The name suited it, as it had many skilled magic users.</p><p>Compared to weaponry or martial arts types, magic users were fewer in number. This made them highly sought after by both small and large clans. The Tower of Magic even hired out its magic users as mercenaries.</p><p>I remembered that in the original story, the Tower of Magic gave tremendous support to Kang Hana. People joked that she might be the daughter of a top executive there. I did not read far enough to see the truth, but I heard her origins came out later on.</p><p>“Wait a minute, Kang Hana? Is your suggestion tied to the Tower of Magic clan?”</p><p>“You caught on quickly. Yes, that’s right.”</p><p>So she really was an executive’s daughter to propose it so casually. My situation was the bigger issue, though.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can keep listening if it involves them.”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“I may be low ranked, but I’m a public servant.”</p><p>An ability user from one clan could talk to members of another clan freely. There was no problem with exchanging visits or being invited elsewhere.</p><p>But a government employee was a different story. Accepting a private clan’s offer in secret could cause serious problems. It might look like bribery, or something corrupt.</p><p>“Oh, I wanted to express our gratitude, and I wondered if that was disallowed too.”</p><p>“Gratitude?”</p><p>“Yes. You recall fighting Orrox, right?”</p><p>By Orrox, she meant that day I fought monsters, then encountered Irina and the Elder in turn. Honestly, the monsters were less frightening than that pair.</p><p>“Sure, I remember. Why?”</p><p>“I heard you rescued an ability user then.”</p><p>I paused, recalling someone named Park Minho. I did help one person who had been badly injured by Orrox.</p><p>“That ability user turned out to be the younger sibling of one of our clan members. They really wanted to thank you, and…”</p><p>“If they just want to say thanks, there are other ways.”</p><p>“It’s… well…”</p><p>“Please be honest. There must be a different reason.”</p><p>If they were truly grateful, they would have come to me themselves. If there were circumstances that prevented that, they could have found alternative methods. Asking me to visit the Tower of Magic clan in person seemed excessive.</p><p>“Well, someone there wants to offer you a place in the clan.”</p><p>“Me? The Tower of Magic clan? I’m not even a magic type.”</p><p>“The Tower of Magic doesn’t only employ magic types. There are plenty of non-magic people who protect them. Most of our famous members happen to be magic users, but we have many other roles too.”</p><p>She continued explaining. A spot recently opened on a hunting team for a support role, but it was hard to find someone capable of detection, measurement, and basic combat. They thought I fit that description.</p><p>“Still, it’s not right to take away government staff like that.”</p><p>“Not if it’s field agents. But you’re administrative. It’s not illegal, so the Tower of Magic need not worry. The restrictions only apply to active field operatives.”</p><p>“That… is a fair point.”</p><p>“Yes. Besides, big clans contribute large sums in taxes and emergency relief. Think of it as them having the right to recruit someone when they need to.”</p><p>It was a capitalist system at its finest. They paid, so they got something in return.</p><p>“I hope you don’t take this the wrong way. They mean well, and they want to give you a good opportunity. The pay and experience would far exceed what you have now.”</p><p>It was a harsh truth, but that was how things worked. The top clans held more prestige than an administrative government job. People would respect that experience more.</p><p>If I were still a regular employee, this would be the chance of a lifetime. Quitting this government job for a top clan would be considered the smarter move. Most people would do it in a heartbeat.</p><p>Yet it was different for me now. I had only just found my footing, so switching to a clan would make no sense.</p><p>“That’s not for me.”</p><p>I had just reached a good place, so leaving would be foolish.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 50</h1><p>TN: Suhyeon&#39;s PoV</p><p>The negotiations that went on for two days finally bore fruit.</p><p>Grandpa told me to take it easy for a while longer, and we had even spoken to the Headmaster, but I left those worries behind. I managed to return to the Academy in the end.</p><p>‘I can’t believe it took two days. Two whole days to get back to the Examiner’s side.’</p><p>I feel terrible toward Grandpa. I know how concerned he was.</p><p>He kept asking what would happen if there was another attack. He begged me to rest just a little more. He practically pleaded, and I hesitated several times.</p><p>Even so, the place I belong is beside him. I want to be right by the person I admire most and show him how I’ve grown. I owe all my progress to the Examiner.</p><p>“Miss, we’ve arrived.”</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll head inside now.”</p><p>I hurried away from the guards who came to see me off and dashed in. The place where Examiner Baek Seojin was stationed lay just ahead.</p><p>I kept imagining his reaction upon seeing me show up when he expected me to rest for a few more days. He would probably be startled that I came back this soon.</p><p>That surprise would last just a moment, though, and then I was certain he would be delighted. He cherished me deeply. That was simply who he was.</p><p>“Examiner!”</p><p>I considered sneaking up on him for a surprise, yet I forgot all about that idea once I actually spotted him. My lips twitched into a grin I struggled to hide as I called his name.</p><p>“Oh. Suhyeon!”</p><p>Examiner Baek Seojin wasn’t alone. Kang Hana stood next to him.</p><p>“Why is Senior here…?”</p><p>That single question flashed through my mind.</p><p>Why did she keep coming? She’d shown up not too long ago as well. Senior Kang Hana wasn’t Bronze or Silver. She was Platinum, so she had nothing to do with Examiner Baek Seojin. Then why did I keep seeing her by his side?</p><p>I pictured how often she must have hung around him while I was away. Then I imagined him treating her with the same warmth he showed me.</p><p>No. I hated it.</p><p>I didn’t want to watch Senior and the Examiner talk any longer.</p><p>Senior Kang Hana was on a whole other level, so much more accomplished than me, brimming with qualities I lacked.</p><p>That thought drove me to drop a piece of secret information I had been holding back. I felt no regret. He turned his attention to me because of it.</p><p>Please, Senior, hurry and leave…</p><p>No, that was wrong. The Examiner was kind, and so was Senior. She was someone who had looked after me, like an older sister, for a long time. I couldn’t let myself feel that way, because it would betray how she had helped me all this time.</p><p>Yes. She probably came here on some errand. She was Student Council President, after all. She’d leave soon, and I’d be the only one left at his side…</p><p>“It’s my off day.”</p><p>Senior said this and went back to talking with him.</p><p>My mouth went dry just hearing that. Then, when she spoke next, my heart dropped.</p><p>“Well, someone there wants to offer you a place in the clan.”</p><p>*</p><p>A clan invitation was the last thing he had expected. It never crossed my mind that such a day would come. Right now, though, it didn’t appeal to him at all.</p><p>He had no real reason to think about it. His answer was already decided.</p><p>“I appreciate the thought, but I’m not interested in joining a clan, Kang Hana.”</p><p>If he entered a clan, he would have to give up his role as Examiner. From his perspective, that would mean losing his most efficient path to growth.</p><p>The Silver Gatekeeper belonged with the Bronze students, not anywhere else.</p><p>He did think about Hana’s pride, so he pretended to mull it over for about thirty seconds, then shook his head and made his stance clear.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I really don’t plan on joining any clan.”</p><p>“Could you at least meet the person making the offer and talk it out?”</p><p>“It wouldn’t change my answer.”</p><p>Even on the surface, accepting the offer would create problems. He had already told students that he was doing this job for them, for the weaker ones. If he suddenly abandoned them for a clan, he would undermine everything he said.</p><p>“If I left for a clan now—or even just entertained that offer—the students would be really disappointed. I made it clear that I’m doing this for those less fortunate, yet if word spread that I jumped ship the moment I got famous, how would that look?”</p><p>“…They wouldn’t be happy.”</p><p>“Exactly. Could you let them know for me, Hana?”</p><p>She said nothing more about persuading him, and instead apologized for overstepping. She admitted that she hadn’t considered how it would look from his side.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Examiner. I think I approached this too lightly.”</p><p>“No, I feel bad too. It’s not every day that an elite clan like The Tower of Magic reaches out first. People would call me crazy for turning down something that rare.”</p><p>The Tower of Magic truly was a phenomenal place. For many ability users, it was their dream job. Outside of the clan led by Han Jiyoon, it was arguably Korea’s best.</p><p>They had offered him a position in person, and he had rejected it on the spot.</p><p>“Please pass my apologies to whoever contacted me about it.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. Once Dad hears the reason, he will definitely appreciate how much the Examiner values our Academy students.”</p><p>“Ah… You mean your father was the one who made the offer? So he’s a core executive in The Tower of Magic?”</p><p>That explained how they wholeheartedly supported Lee Hyunwoo earlier in the story. It wasn’t something a low-level official could do.</p><p>“Huh? Wait, you didn’t know? I thought you were aware.”</p><p>I was confused for a moment, but Kim Suhyeon answered on her behalf.</p><p>“Examiner, Hana’s father is actually The Tower of Magic’s Clan Master.”</p><p>So not just an executive, but the actual Master of The Tower of Magic? One of the strongest clans in Korea, with a legendary status in magic. He was the top figure of that place.</p><p>I made a mental note never to mention this fiasco to anyone else. If people found out The Tower of Magic’s clan master had personally reached out, then got rejected, I’d be pelted with accusations of arrogance.</p><p>Beep—</p><p>“…Oh, I’m sorry. Something else came up. I need to go! See you both next time!”</p><p>Hana checked her watch as it let out a noisy alert, then dashed toward the main building where the Student Council was located.</p><p>“She left,” Kim Suhyeon mumbled. At last, a smile returned to her face.</p><p>Please, Suhyeon, don’t get so intense. Let’s not go down that path.</p><p>“I figured you would do that, Examiner.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Turn down her offer. I knew you’d stay here.”</p><p>I almost told her that it was simply a calculated move. Of course, I kept that to myself.</p><p>“Of course I’m staying. The students’ levels haven’t risen yet, plus Hyunwoo, you, and others have a long way to go. Many students have high expectations. I’m not leaving.”</p><p>“That’s what I expected. Yes. That’s how you are, Examiner.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon flashed a brilliant smile and leaned lightly against me. It made me wonder how this girl could ever become the Crimson Witch.</p><p>***</p><p>“Done for the day!”</p><p>Kang Hana left the Academy, not heading home but turning in the opposite direction.</p><p>That district housed countless clan headquarters. Among those, the largest in size was none other than The Tower of Magic, her destination.</p><p>She stepped inside, and a few people greeted her along the way.</p><p>“Oh, welcome, Miss.”</p><p>“Really! I’ve asked you all not to call me that.”</p><p>“I can’t help it. The nickname’s stuck.”</p><p>Hana frowned at the clan member’s greeting, but they refused to drop the term “Miss.” In their eyes, that was an expression of trust toward the Clan Master’s daughter, as well as a show of closeness toward her. She gave up on correcting them and headed to the top floor.</p><p>Knock, knock—</p><p>“Dad, it’s me.”</p><p>“Come on in.”</p><p>A middle-aged man welcomed her kindly when she opened the door. He was Kang Inbeom, The Tower of Magic’s Clan Master, an A-rank ability user, and a master of fire magic.</p><p>“You’re here. Have you been well?”</p><p>“Yes. Oh, by the way, Suhyeon came back to school today.”</p><p>“Already? I didn’t think they’d let her leave so soon.”</p><p>Hana shrugged, then got straight to the point.</p><p>“The Examiner turned down the offer.”</p><p>“Even after I mentioned meeting in person?”</p><p>“I didn’t drop your name outright. I just said someone wanted to see him. I worried he might feel pressured or get the wrong idea. Did I mess up?”</p><p>“No, not at all. He saved the granddaughter of the man I respect the most. We can’t come off as rude.”</p><p>Kang Inbeom deeply admired Kang Minseong, though they were unrelated by blood. Baek Seojin was the one who saved that man’s granddaughter, so he was taking every precaution not to offend him.</p><p>“He seems truly admirable. When he explained his reason for refusing, I felt a little ashamed myself.”</p><p>Hana told her father why Baek Seojin had said no.</p><p>After hearing about the Examiner’s sense of duty toward the Academy students, Kang Inbeom let out a long exhale.</p><p>“What a fine young man, and we clumsily tried to recruit him. People like him are a rare breed these days.”</p><p>“I’m also worried we might have given The Tower of Magic a bad name in his eyes.”</p><p>“You’re right. We don’t want that. I’ve been thinking, and I have an idea. If the Examiner ever ends up in a tough spot, how about The Tower of Magic steps in to help him? That would probably be a little better, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Although it’s unlikely someone like him will face serious trouble… still, it’s not a bad plan.”</p><p>Without even realizing it, Baek Seojin owed a debt to The Tower of Magic.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 51</h1><p>Another rank evaluation, another experience. Through this, I realized something all over again.</p><p>Crimson Witch, Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>If that woman had turned villain, she would have been the worst nightmare of all.</p><p>“Hah… hah….”</p><p>This time too, her chronic stamina issue caught up with her.</p><p>Gasping for breath, Kim Suhyeon sank to the ground.</p><p>However, her offensive power had been so overwhelming that I could only marvel.</p><p>Even though I had seen two Elders, plus the extraordinary Irina, I still got chills from Kim Suhyeon’s fierce attacks. It was the first time since facing those two Elders and Irina that I felt that eerie “Oh, this is terrifying” feeling.</p><p>Seriously… this girl is on the same broken level as Lee Hyunwoo.</p><p>If Irina was a fully developed top-tier from the start, then Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon were the kind of top-tiers who grew over time.</p><p>Honestly, I never worried about Lee Hyunwoo, because I knew he would look after himself and flourish on his own. That left only Kim Suhyeon. If she kept things up like this, I had no more wishes to make.</p><p>Thanks to that, I was improving quickly as well.</p><p>I tackled my stamina issue by working out like a madman after leaving the office every day. Yet there was a limit to how much actual battle experience I could gain just from rank evaluations. Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon helped me transcend that limit.</p><p>The more evaluations I did, the sharper my judgment and movement became. Fighting the Elder, glimpsing Irina’s instantaneous power—those experiences allowed me to mimic them, if not precisely, then at least to a decent level.</p><p>The only explanation is the Gatekeeper Trait.</p><p>Otherwise, maybe I’d have to be some lab-created superhuman who broke free of a facility to explain my present growth.</p><p>Anyway, I now have another reason to keep acting as a Gatekeeper.</p><p>I have to keep facing the stronger ones, absorbing everything about their moves, their choices, even down to their combat breathing.</p><p>For that, they need to keep improving. If I just tested people who stayed weak, there would be no benefit. It would be like a high-level gamer grinding in a level 1 hunting zone.</p><p>“I—I’m sorry. I can’t go on….”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. This is enough.”</p><p>Truthfully, I wanted to just drop to the ground. I was still the Examiner, so I couldn’t do that right after declaring a failed attempt. I clenched my teeth, forcing strength back into my shaky legs.</p><p>“I failed again, right? Sorry. I really gave it my all….”</p><p>“Why apologize? How do you think the others would feel if you do that? Don’t say stuff like that.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon had mostly escaped that crushing inferiority complex. Yet a faint trace of it remained.</p><p>If she sensed the slightest shortcoming in herself, she turned to self-deprecation. I couldn’t relax while that habit lingered.</p><p>A wounded mind doesn’t heal completely. People live with it for the rest of their lives. I recalled hearing that somewhere, and I gently reassured Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>“Suhyeon, did you learn your sword style from Chairman Kang Minseong?”</p><p>“Huh? Oh… He did show me a few things, but he never taught me the way he taught my cousin. Back then, I felt I was too weak and pathetic, so I cried and insisted I hated it….”</p><p>So she never got formal lessons, yet she was already this good?</p><p>Chairman Kang Minseong, called the “Sword Demon,” never personally devoted himself to training her. Yet for a moment, I, who could handle near-B-rank villains just fine, was pushed back by her.</p><p>“Hah….”</p><p>I sighed automatically. If what she said was true, then Kim Suhyeon’s talent was overwhelming.</p><p>If her ability had blossomed properly from the start, how incredible could she have become?</p><p>She belonged to a top-tier weaponry family, and she had Kang Minseong as a potential teacher. Other excellent ability users must have been around as well, so she would have soared quickly.</p><p>How did she end up with crippling self-doubt despite having such broken talent? She could have become more gifted than anyone else. I couldn’t understand it, no matter how many times I thought about it.</p><p>…No, maybe it makes sense. She was created for this role.</p><p>She was meant to be the most dangerous foe, overshadowing other villains. The story hammered that point by giving her all those details. At least I broke that cycle in time.</p><p>Even showing half her present skill would have reached Gold by the Academy’s standard. Stamina aside, Silver would have been a lock.</p><p>“Why… what did I do wrong?”</p><p>“Oh, no. Nothing at all. That wasn’t a sigh. Honest, Suhyeon.”</p><p>“Oh… that’s a relief. I thought maybe…”</p><p>She clutched her chest in relief.</p><p>Yes. Those old traces were still there. She looked fine now, but if anything toxic slipped through the cracks, she could revert.</p><p>At least we avoided a crisis so far. The problem was that she had already awakened her Crimson Witch side. If some new trauma came along, it might be devastating.</p><p>“Suhyeon.”</p><p>She wasn’t clueless about who she relied on most right now.</p><p>Me. Baek Seojin.</p><p>Sure, she leaned on her grandfather Kang Minseong too, but not like she did with me. I was the only one who could steer her and keep her on the right path.</p><p>I’d use that. This situation, Kim Suhyeon herself, and me.</p><p>All to reach the best result for both of us, guiding everything in the most positive way I could.</p><p>“Remember when we said we’d have dinner together? That never happened, because you got ambushed by those villains.”</p><p>“Ah… right. I’m so sorry about that. The villains jumped me, so…”</p><p>“Don’t apologize. It wasn’t your fault, Suhyeon.”</p><p>I patted her head lightly. She was not to blame if villains targeted her.</p><p>“How about tonight? Are you free? I’ve been looking forward to that dinner you promised me. Unless it’s too much trouble…”</p><p>“No, no! Absolutely not! That’s great! T-tonight?! Tonight is good, right?!”</p><p>She had been sitting there moments ago, exhausted. Suddenly she was on her feet, grabbing my hands and jumping around. Her eyes sparkled so brightly that I worried if I said I couldn’t make it, she might snap and become the Crimson Witch.</p><p>“R-right now! We could even go now! Want to go right now?! I have the rest of today off anyway!”</p><p>“Suhyeon, calm down. It’s still my work hours.”</p><p>The Headmaster had my back, and Irina treated me as a friend, but I was still a civil servant. It was only right to stay until quitting time. I wasn’t about to do anything illegal. A little idle time was one thing, but I didn’t want to break rules.</p><p>Realizing she was overexcited, Suhyeon tried to calm down. She still shook my hands joyfully, though.</p><p>“I’ll see you after I clock out. Let’s meet at the main gate.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Watching Suhyeon look so happy made me feel pretty good too.</p><p>*</p><p>…I never saw this situation coming.</p><p>I finished work in a great mood, then headed to the main gate to meet Kim Suhyeon as planned.</p><p>I just hoped no more villains appeared. We were finally about to celebrate her stepping onto the path of a true ability user…</p><p>“There he is. Been a while, handsome oppa?”</p><p>“…Irina?”</p><p>That crazy blonde, Irina. She was standing at the main gate.</p><p>‘Why was she here again?’</p><p>I glanced sideways, noticing Kim Suhyeon’s wary eyes and the tense bodyguards. Suhyeon was especially on edge, sneaking hostile looks at Irina.</p><p>That was a bad sign. A very bad sign.</p><p>‘Don’t do it, Suhyeon. She’s way out of your league right now.’</p><p>Irina either didn’t notice or didn’t care. She grinned lazily, letting out a playful hum.</p><p>“Strange. You look even better than last time.”</p><p>“I haven’t had any plastic surgery.”</p><p>“Right. Of course you haven’t.”</p><p>She suddenly darted close, letting me catch a soft fragrance. My mind went blank for a second.</p><p>“Instead, maybe you got stronger.”</p><p>The instant she said that, I snapped back to reality and jumped away. She beamed at me.</p><p>She was crazy, but she really was pretty. Thinking that probably made me insane too, like I’d caught her craziness.</p><p>“It’s closing time, right?”</p><p>“Yes. As you can see.”</p><p>“Then come with me for a bit.”</p><p>“Uh, sorry, but I—”</p><p>“The Examiner already has plans!”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon shouted before I could answer. Her voice was so loud that even the bodyguards jumped.</p><p>“Oh. Did you just yell at me?”</p><p>Irina, sounding surprised, looked at Suhyeon. She was still smiling, but her eyes had gone cold.</p><p>“You don’t know who I am? I might ‘Oh my, you scared me!’ and slap you upside the head. You’d get flattened.”</p><p>That was an outright threat. The bodyguards tensed, but they knew it was pointless. She was Irina.</p><p>“The Examiner already has plans.”</p><p>Suhyeon wasn’t backing down for a second. She looked ready to throttle Irina if they kept this up.</p><p>Crimson Witch vs. the Crazy Blonde. Tension crackled. Irina would obviously win. She could take out the current Suhyeon in five seconds.</p><p>I hoped Suhyeon would get frightened and back off, but she showed no sign of it.</p><p>“…Unbelievable.”</p><p>To my surprise, Irina stepped back a little, gazing at me in disbelief.</p><p>“Hey, Seojin oppa? Who is she? What’s she so confident about?”</p><p>&quot;I’ve never seen anyone like her before. Maybe she doesn’t know who I am? No way. In this hellish plac… ah, sorry. In South Korea, there’s no one who doesn’t know the ultra-beautiful, ultra-powerful Irina, right?&quot;</p><p>To be able to say crap like that in front of everyone without batting an eye…</p><p>She really earned that nickname of ‘crazy blonde.’</p><p>Hi readers, currently we need 9 (goals: 64 votes) more votes on NovelBin to reach the vote goals. 1 extra chapters will be unlocked if we reached the vote goals.</p><p>Happy reading!</p><p>If you enjoyed the novel, please leave a rating and review on NovelBin.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 52</h1><p>She truly seemed taken aback. People usually cowered or fled the instant Irina showed up. One slip, and they might end up tasting the full force of an S-rank’s punch. That was a shortcut to the afterlife.</p><p>Suhyeon was ignoring all that danger and hissing at her like an angry cat. Irina was too shocked by such a scenario to lash out.</p><p>Bodyguards crept toward Suhyeon, and Irina wailed in protest.</p><p>“Wow, that hurts my feelings. I haven’t done anything yet! Why is everyone acting like this?!”</p><p>It was time for me to step in. Irina hadn’t come here to kill time, which meant only one reason remained.</p><p>‘Why me again? First the Elder, now the crazy lady. Did my Gatekeeper Trait come with some hidden pheromone effect or something?’</p><p>I rechecked, but I found no sign of that.</p><p>“Irina, I already have dinner plans with Student Kim Suhyeon.”</p><p>“Dinner with a girl? Wow, Handsome Seojin oppa. So you’re not single?”</p><p>Why was she still going on about singledom? She needed new material.</p><p>“…I don’t think she’s as good as me.”</p><p>Irina muttered, glaring at Suhyeon. Then she let out an “Ah!” as if she realized something.</p><p>“Is that your preference? Since I’m not Korean? Maybe you only want to date a Korean?”</p><p>“Don’t say weird stuff. We live in a global age, right?”</p><p>Her question was so random that it froze me up. What went through that head of hers?</p><p>“Or do you mean you refuse to date me but like dating her?”</p><p>“Wait, hold on. I never said anything about dating.”</p><p>“When a man and woman have dinner, that’s it, isn’t it? They eat, then visit a cafe and watch a movie. If it gets late, they go to a motel. Then they taste each other’s bodies….”</p><p>That was outrageous. I slapped my hand over Irina’s mouth without thinking.</p><p>“Mph.”</p><p>She gave me a strange look. I realized a second too late that grabbing her face might earn me a sudden death.</p><p>I cleared my throat and withdrew my hand. Thankfully, she didn’t snap. I was still alive.</p><p>“Ahem. There are students around, you know. You’re Korea’s strongest, so please act the part.”</p><p>“Wow! You’re complimenting me, right?”</p><p>I told her to have some dignity, but she interpreted it that way. What a remarkable mind she had.</p><p>“Anyway, we’re just having dinner.”</p><p>“So you say. Right, Suhyeon?”</p><p>…Suhyeon? Why was there no response? Was she still angry?</p><p>I turned to see her face bright red, ready to pop. That wasn’t good. If she reached her limit, there was a chance she’d explode and rampage.</p><p>“Fine. Then I’ll come along.”</p><p>“…What?”</p><p>“If it’s really just a simple dinner, I’ll join.”</p><p>“Why would you tag along? What’s your reason?”</p><p>“Plenty of reasons. I clashed with the Elder because of you, Seojin oppa.”</p><p>Excuse me, what? Since when was that my fault?</p><p>“I heard some punks attacked you. I was furious when I found out.”</p><p>“Why would that make you angry?”</p><p>Yes, Suhyeon. Exactly. That was my question too. What does that have to do with anything?</p><p>“Obviously I’m mad. I claimed you first. If someone wants to fight you, it has to be me alone. If you get hurt, it has to be by me. I can’t let anyone else touch you. Never. I’d kill them.”</p><p>She said if I got injured at her hands, it was better. But that would be more lethal than any minor wound.</p><p>“I won’t stand by and watch the Examiner get hurt.”</p><p>Kim Suhyeon’s voice was low and steady as she cut Irina off. She seemed like a pissed-off cat, or maybe more.</p><p>“Hey, you keep spouting off. It’s getting on my nerves, so enough.”</p><p>“I think you’re being even more rude.”</p><p>The timid Suhyeon had truly changed, or maybe she just acted this way around Irina. The bodyguards looked just as surprised.</p><p>…Oh, maybe they were stunned that she dared speak to Irina that way.</p><p>“Plus, I already hit a few villain groups in your name, Seojin oppa. I was scolded so hard by Mom and Dad. I also plan to wreck Jinhan Group next.”</p><p>“Why them?”</p><p>“Do you have proof?”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. They tried messing with my Seojin oppa, so they’re as good as gone.”</p><p>She was unhinged. I had no idea why she obsessed over me. She planned to punish random folks without evidence.</p><p>I expected Suhyeon to call that insane, but she stayed quiet. She even nodded like she understood Irina’s point.</p><p>“In any case, after all that trouble, I deserve a dinner with you. I worked for it.”</p><p>I never asked her to do any of that. Still, telling her that would cause trouble.</p><p>“Then no.”</p><p>Suhyeon spoke up again.</p><p>“You. I said stop butting in.”</p><p>“I mean it. The Examiner—he’s coming to my place tonight.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“He’s going to your house?”</p><p>What? Out of nowhere, she said I was going to her house.</p><p>Irina glanced at me, obviously waiting for an explanation. I couldn’t give one. I was clueless. Don’t look at me like that, you crazy lady. I have no idea.</p><p>“G-Grandpa asked! He said he wants to share a meal with you, so… right, yes, that’s why.”</p><p>“Your grandpa…”</p><p>“Chairman Kang Minseong.”</p><p>A bodyguard provided that detail. Irina said, “Oh,” then mumbled, “I find that old guy a bit of a pain.”</p><p>“So are you still coming?”</p><p>“Argh, that’s right. You’re that old man’s granddaughter. Ugh, so annoying.”</p><p>Irina scratched her head in frustration, let out a sigh, and shrugged.</p><p>“I can’t help it, Seojin oppa. I’ll have dinner next time. You’re not going there alone, so I won’t bother. I hate that old man. I’m not crazy enough to do that.”</p><p>She grumbled, then suddenly stepped closer. She grabbed me in a quick hug, whispering in my ear.</p><p>“Promise me. Next time, it’s my turn. I worked hard for that much, at least.”</p><p>“…I’m not sure you ‘worked hard,’ but okay.”</p><p>“Don’t be stingy. Let me have that. This super gorgeous lady is asking you so nicely. Do I look easy or something?”</p><p>She definitely wasn’t easy. She was just crazy.</p><p>“Fine. We’ll have dinner next time.”</p><p>“Okay, deal. Then I’ll be off.”</p><p>After Irina left, I got into Suhyeon’s car again. I asked, just to confirm,</p><p>“Suhyeon, about going to Chairman Kang Minseong… that’s real?”</p><p>“That… I kind of said it on the spot. I’m thinking about it… but it seems like we have to go, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. I think we should. If Irina finds out we lied, things would get messy.”</p><p>I’d rather endure a visit to Kang Minseong’s estate than get on Irina’s bad side.</p><p>“It actually works out well, Miss. The Chairman has been saying he wants to thank Examiner Baek Seojin properly. He’s brought it up more than once.”</p><p>The chief bodyguard grinned as he said so. Looks like everything lined up, though I wasn’t expecting to end up at Kang Minseong’s place.</p><p>Is this okay? I turned down an offer to visit the Tower clan because I was a public servant, yet now I was heading to a place more prestigious than most clans.</p><p>Well, if that causes issues… maybe Ma Hakjun or Kang Minseong can handle it somehow.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 53</h1><p>At some point, Kang Minseong had expected this day to come. He had precious grandsons and granddaughters, and he imagined they would someday bring home a future son-in-law or daughter-in-law. He even hoped to see grandchildren of his grandchildren, if possible.</p><p>With that in mind, he took meticulous care of himself. He vowed to stay vigorous and healthy until that moment arrived.</p><p>‘But….’</p><p>Even so, facing the moment in real life was overwhelming.</p><p>“H-Grandpa.”</p><p>“It’s been a while, Chairman.”</p><p>His granddaughter, Kim Suhyeon, typically confident but now sporting an uneasy smile, stood there. Next to her was the young man who saved her twice, Baek Seojin. They both showed up at his door without warning.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the two came here to avoid Irina. They had to stick to their excuse; otherwise, dealing with that crazy woman would be impossible.</p><p>Yet Kang Minseong didn’t know that part. In his eyes, it looked like this:</p><p>Ah, my granddaughter came to introduce her boyfriend to her grandpa.</p><p>‘So… he’s really Suhyeon’s boyfriend now, is he.’</p><p>He had half-expected something like this might happen eventually.</p><p>If a person helped someone in a dire situation, that someone naturally felt gratitude or affection. In this case, he hadn’t just helped her once, but twice, and he gave it everything he had both times. He even risked his life to stand up for her.</p><p>‘Of course our Suhyeon would be smitten. It makes sense.’</p><p>He glanced at Baek Seojin again. The first time they met, he was just an ability user with decent luck, or so it seemed. Nothing special. At least that’s how he felt in that moment.</p><p>But seeing him now, he realized he might have judged incorrectly.</p><p>He had grown in a short span, enough to impress even someone like Kang Minseong. Maybe his ability had only just blossomed, or maybe all his training was finally paying off. Either way, he seemed like a completely different person from before.</p><p>‘When I saw him at the hospital, he wasn’t on this level. Not even close.’</p><p>Watching him stirred the old swordsman’s curiosity. How far did this young man’s real skill go? He had lived through fighting Elders, faced hordes of villains, and kept growing at a shocking rate. Where was his ceiling?</p><p>“Grandpa?”</p><p>“Huh? Ah, sorry. I got a little flustered. I never thought my Suhyeon would bring her boyfriend home this soon. Hahaha!”</p><p>“W-wait, no! It’s nothing like that, Grandpa! The Examiner just—uh, well, we came for dinner….”</p><p>Who would invite someone over for dinner if there wasn’t a reason, though? He might be old, but not so clueless.</p><p>Suhyeon’s face was bright red. If it were truly just a meal, would she blush like that?</p><p>“That boy. He’s completely head over heels, huh? Well, if he’s at that level, then he gets the stamp of approval as Suhyeon’s boyfriend.”</p><p>First of all, and most fundamentally—he’s an Awakened, just like Suhyeon.</p><p>Does Kang Minseong discriminate against non-Awakened people? No, that’s not the reason.</p><p>Men and women understand each other best when they stand on equal footing.</p><p>Awakened and non-Awakened can fall in love, sure—but it rarely ends well.</p><p>If the places they stand—and more importantly, the places they still need to go—are too far apart, conflict is inevitable.</p><p>And if that keeps up, they’ll eventually break up without ever truly understanding one another, leaving only pain behind.</p><p>So the fact that he’s an Awakened already gave him peace of mind.</p><p>And on top of that, his abilities as an Awakened are exceptional. He stood alone in front of an Elder. Took on a villain group by himself. And didn’t they say he made a name for himself during the Gate Incident?</p><p>“He was even treated with respect by Irina—that crazy blonde girl, wasn&#39;t he?”</p><p>Not long ago, he saw an article and let out a dumbfounded laugh. He couldn’t believe that crazy woman would actually pose for a photo like that—shaking hands. Irina, of all people. The same Irina who used to click her tongue in disgust just looking at up-and-coming talents.</p><p>And yet, unlike most young folks these days, he’s got a genuinely good character.</p><p>Why he insists on being an academy examiner—a position bound to stir resentment—he already heard the reason from Kim Suhyeon.</p><p>If his picky friend, Ma Hakjun, vouched for him, then the vetting’s already done. There’s no way he would treat his granddaughter poorly, or ever cast her aside halfway through.</p><p>‘And he saved Suhyeon three times—right, not just twice.’</p><p>He protected her from the Elder once, fought off those street ambush villains another time, and rescued her from the heavy negativity eating away at her mind. He was a benefactor in so many ways that “benefactor” didn’t go far enough. If Suhyeon liked him, there was no reason for Grandpa to object.</p><p>Still, there was one thing he wanted to address.</p><p>“You should’ve told me in advance. Then I could’ve prepared a better dinner.”</p><p>“Well, you know, I was in such a hurry to get here that I didn&#39;t tell you.”</p><p>“No, Mr. President. I apologized for coming so suddenly.”</p><p>“Nonsense. I’m happy to see you. If anything, I should thank you, young man, for how Suhyeon has changed.”</p><p>He summoned the house staff, telling them to prepare a feast fit for a truly important guest. Time wasn’t an issue, as long as the meal came out spectacularly.</p><p>“Chairman, that’s too much. We arrived out of nowhere, so—”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. Actually, I need an excuse to keep you around a while longer.”</p><p>“What do you mean, exactly?”</p><p>“Your name is Baek Seojin, if I recall. Would you have a duel with me?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“G-Grandpa?!”</p><p>Suhyeon was more flustered than Seojin, fretting that he might be offended. She didn’t want him to get the wrong idea.</p><p>‘…It’s the perfect chance.’</p><p>Yet, far from being upset, Seojin hardly seemed bothered.</p><p>Every time he faced a new opponent, he gleaned one or two of their strengths. He noted their mistakes so he wouldn’t make them himself. By acting as a Gatekeeper, he wasn’t just growing from daily routines; each opponent’s moves and decisions enriched him. The more formidable the foe, the more he gained.</p><p>“Oh, don’t get me wrong. I’m not forcing you. Call it an old man’s foolishness. Suhyeon’s been bragging about your accomplishments. If even half of it is true, it’s like you’re an S-rank.”</p><p>“Suhyeon said that? I’m embarrassed. I’m not sure I could handle someone at A-rank.”</p><p>He scratched his cheek. Then, after clearing his throat, he spoke again.</p><p>“All right, let’s do it, Chairman.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You and me, having a match.”</p><p>“Ohh. You’re really okay with that?”</p><p>“Yes. Feels like a good opportunity for me.”</p><p>“I’m not pushing. Let me be sure—are you accepting my request of your own free will?”</p><p>At that, Seojin crisply said yes. Pleased by such a forthright response, Kang Minseong roared with laughter. This young man was exactly to his liking. Yes, an ideal match for his granddaughter.</p><p>“Though, I do have one condition.”</p><p>“A condition? Certainly. Name it. Anything.”</p><p>“When you and I spar, I’d like Suhyeon to watch alongside us.”</p><p>“Oh? You want to show off your moves to her?”</p><p>In reality, it was about triggering his Gatekeeper trait. But Seojin knew there was no need to speak the entire truth.</p><p>“She grows stronger by watching as well, since she’s a genius.”</p><p>“Haha! Indeed, my Suhyeon is a genius!”</p><p>He unintentionally earned bonus points in that moment.</p><p>*</p><p>He never expected to spar with Kang Minseong. Truth be told, part of him worried about how risky it might be.</p><p>This was no average old man, but a veteran surpassing some A-ranks. Villains dreaded him, calling him the Sword Demon. He might have glimpsed an Elder’s power and witnessed Irina’s skill, but he had never fought them at full strength.</p><p>He did improve a lot lately, sparring with Lee Hyunwoo and Kim Suhyeon—both on a roll themselves. Still, he had ways to go. Challenging someone at Kang Minseong’s level offered benefits, but carried risks.</p><p>‘Plus, I can’t believe this place has a massive training arena as well.’</p><p>He felt like he’d stepped into a small college campus upon visiting the Kang estate. Ordinary rich people had a big house with a spacious yard. This property boasted entire clusters of large buildings. It almost felt like multiple clans merged into one.</p><p>“All right, let’s keep this simple.”</p><p>His gentle grandfatherly demeanor vanished the moment he gripped a sword. His face showed an entirely different energy.</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye</p><p>◎ Kang Minseong</p><p>The Everlasting Sword</p><p>◎ Details</p><p>Even with the passage of time, his aura remains undiminished.</p><p>When wielding a sword, all abilities are enhanced.</p><p>Except in one particular scenario, he will never falter.</p><p>It was a simple trait, which made it all the more daunting. He gained a boost whenever he held a sword. That definitely suited Kim Suhyeon’s grandfather.</p><p>“You’re in a support role, right?”</p><p>“Yes, but I won’t ask for any help.”</p><p>No need to hold back or allow him extra moves. If he wanted to gain something, he had to pay the price, whether money, time, or, in this case, sheer fortitude.</p><p>‘I’ll just endure.’</p><p>Hearing that, Kang Minseong chuckled and clapped his hands.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 54</h1><p>I steadied my thoughts and turned my gaze toward Kang Minseong.</p><p>That man was determined to surpass me, and I had to block his way. Thinking that way, it didn’t take long before my trait activated.</p><p>- Activating The Third Eye.</p><p>◎ Sole Examiner</p><p>Trait is active.</p><p>Opponent has not received a promotion from Baek Seojin.</p><p>Treating them as an examinee.</p><p>Compared to that time I faced the Elder or even the recent villain battle, though, this felt a bit off. It couldn’t be helped. This was only a roundabout way to gain experience, something outside my Gatekeeper duties.</p><p>‘All right. I’m set. Let’s make the first move on my side.’</p><p>I decided to start the way Lee Hyunwoo liked to open. I planted my feet firmly, gripped the hilt, and focused on a single point as I closed the distance.</p><p>My best opening choice was to lunge in from the start with the finest thrust I could manage. I didn’t have to worry about hurting him, since he was stronger than me anyway.</p><p>My target was his shoulder. I aimed for that spot alone.</p><p>Striking the chest or stomach could cause serious harm, but it was easier for the opponent to block. It seemed better to take him down piece by piece from the outer edges.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting a miracle, but…</p><p>‘…Hell.’</p><p>This was way too overwhelming.</p><p>Chaaang—!</p><p>I couldn’t follow it with my eyes. I basically missed it. One moment, I saw him lift his foot lightly; the next, he was already upon me. He swung his sword effortlessly, and my attempt at a first strike crumbled right there.</p><p>I froze. I knew he was amazing, but not like this.</p><p>“Hup!”</p><p>I forced away the shock. I recalled mistakes my students once made. They panicked whenever their first move got shut down, then lost their rhythm and their breathing.</p><p>Lee Hyunwoo was different. He always had a backup plan if his first move failed. If that also failed, he picked something else on the spot and carried it out. The fact that he never panicked gave me a real headache. People who figured out answers on their own were the most dangerous of all.</p><p>“Hmm!”</p><p>Instead of backing away, I pushed in even closer. Kang Minseong gave a short hum. From his perspective, I guess he saw that as the right choice.</p><p>‘Thank goodness.’</p><p>Yes, that meant I wasn’t making a mistake. If he agreed that this was the best strategy, then Lee Hyunwoo’s approach was correct too.</p><p>I thrust, I slashed, I retreated briefly, then swung upward, then struck down. I couldn’t let myself waver. I couldn’t let myself panic. I wouldn’t think I was losing, not until I was actually beaten.</p><p>‘I can do this. I can take him down. I can stop him.’</p><p>I repeated that a few times, straining to create an opening in his defenses.</p><p>Even a tiny opening for a split second was enough. If I opened it and shook his balance, that would be enough. Then I could keep pressing, once I had found that first bit of contact.</p><p>A little more, just a bit more. If I could just go a bit further, I was sure I’d see something. Right then, I spotted it in his moves—an opening. I made no hesitation, letting my instincts guide me straight for that spot.</p><p>Tung—!</p><p>In that moment, I felt myself abruptly lifted off my feet, followed by a jarring impact rocking my body. A sharp pain radiated across my back, and for a second, breathing got very hard.</p><p>I regained my senses to find I was flat on my back. Seemed that so-called opening had been a trap he set deliberately.</p><p>“Examiner! Examiner, are you all right?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine. I just fell on my back. Don’t worry, Suhyeon.”</p><p>Though honestly, I was a little not fine. My back was throbbing badly enough that I’d probably feel it for a day or so. I didn’t admit that out loud. I wasn’t sure how Suhyeon would react, so I kept silent.</p><p>As I got to my feet, I saw that Kang Minseong had already sheathed his blade and was coming over.</p><p>“Are you all right? I tried to go as easy as possible. Sorry about that.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. If you say sorry, Chairman, that only embarrasses me more.”</p><p>Walking away from a bout with an ability user with just a fall was a bargain. At the Academy alone, I had gotten cut or had literal chunks of me torn. If all I had now was a sore back, that was a gift.</p><p>Plus, it wasn’t like I had learned nothing. Though faint, it was there in my mind. Especially that final moment, when he used my own momentum while turning aside my attack. I perceived a fragment of how his sword worked, which was my biggest gain.</p><p>‘There’s one problem….’</p><p>Failed to guard the gate.</p><p>That was the part I’d worried about all along.</p><p>What penalty did I suffer, or what outcome did failing bring, if I lost with my trait activated? Whether these extra-duties duels were worth the risk—this was what concerned me.</p><p>This evaluation took place outside the Academy.</p><p>Physical damage to your body is extremely minimal.</p><p>Mental damage is also extremely minimal.</p><p>Considering these factors, the penalty gauge is rising.</p><p>A weird gauge appeared under the trait window, part of it filling in black.</p><p>‘It’s about… ten percent, I think.’</p><p>At least losing didn’t destroy me outright. If we had been at the Academy and someone like Jung Yuhyeon had shredded me, I bet that gauge would’ve shot through the ceiling.</p><p>If the penalty gauge hits maximum, parts of your trait may reset.</p><p>If the penalty accumulates further, the entire trait may vanish.</p><p>So it could take away what it once gave me. That was dirty. The world’s most underhanded trick is giving something, then snatching it back.</p><p>I could breathe easier for now, though, since I didn’t suffer the penalty right away. I just confirmed that a spar like this could still raise that penalty gauge, so every time I triggered the trait, I’d have to push myself.</p><p>Come to think of it, the Gatekeepers I faced in my old life had to grind their teeth all the time. That memory made all of this make sense.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>“Eh? S-Suhyeon?”</p><p>“You were too harsh! The Examiner could have been hurt!”</p><p>“But, Suhyeon, I really did hold back.”</p><p>“That was holding back?! That’s too much! I’m the one who invited him over, and if he gets upset, then—if he hates me—!”</p><p>No, Suhyeon. Really, it’s fine.</p><p>I did get a small penalty, but I gleaned new insight into Kang Minseong’s sword. I’d call that a good trade.</p><p>“Suhyeon, I knew what I was getting into. I’m fine. Don’t blame your grandfather.”</p><p>“…But…”</p><p>I gently chided her, and she stopped mid-sentence. She realized how she sounded, covered her mouth with both hands, and blushed. She looked so cute that I patted her head, making her beam again.</p><p>“Anyway, thanks again for teaching me, Chairman.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Chairman?”</p><p>“Oh, yes. Forgive an old man’s foolishness. You humored my whim, so I’m sure it was rough on you. Go wash up and change clothes. We’ll take care of laundering and return them to your home.”</p><p>I was actually kind of excited about having the powerful Kang family do my laundry.</p><p>TN: That&#39;s the thing that make you excited? hahaha</p><p>Yuyu: Fr fr.</p><p>*</p><p>Afterward, the three of us shared a meal. As promised, the feast prepared was stunning.</p><p>When I gasped in awe, Suhyeon burst out laughing, saying it was so unusual to see me startled.</p><p>“Examiner, try this too.”</p><p>“Also have some of this. The chef here is amazing.”</p><p>“They say this dish uses a rare ingredient. Grandpa only serves this if an important guest is visiting….”</p><p>Suhyeon chatted on and on, and from the side, Kang Minseong watched her quietly. When was the last time he’d seen his granddaughter this lively, talking so much, smiling so widely? He couldn’t remember. It had been so long, it felt strange.</p><p>‘She really could smile like that.’</p><p>He glanced at Suhyeon, then shifted his gaze back to Baek Seojin.</p><p>‘He’s remarkable. He’s very strong, yet also quite peculiar.’</p><p>At first, he assumed it was simply someone whose ability awakened late in life. That happened, for example with Suhyeon. Yet after their spar, he realized there might be more to it. Maybe he didn’t just get a late start.</p><p>‘During that single moment, he tried to adapt the concept of “shaetbaram.”’</p><p>When Seojin opened with that initial thrust, Minseong was quietly impressed. He thought to himself that novices often made the mistake of going for a so-called fatal blow right away, only to be blocked easily, because vital points were protected deeper inside. This man instead targeted the shoulder from the outside, which was a sharper idea.</p><p>So Minseong responded by revealing some of his most subtle skill. Call it a demonstration, a small gift to someone who had saved his granddaughter. “Shaetbaram” was a sword technique using the slightest shift in the breeze to disrupt an opponent entirely. He had never shown it so openly to anyone but his family and the comrades he’d fought alongside.</p><p>Yet at the end, when Minseong finished him off with “soseulbaram,” Seojin had tried to use an incomplete version of shaetbaram’s principle. He couldn’t succeed—it happened too fast, and soseulbaram had already landed. But Minseong clearly saw that impressive capacity for mimicry and absorption.</p><p>“Thank you for the meal, Chairman.”</p><p>“Grandpa, I’ll see the Examiner home now, okay?”</p><p>After dinner, Seojin headed out, and Suhyeon went along. Then, alone in his study, Kang Minseong picked up the phone.</p><p>[…What is it this time?]</p><p>That curt voice on the other end belonged to Ma Hakjun, the current Academy Headmaster, an old comrade, and a hero of ages past.</p><p>“Hakjun, are you busy?”</p><p>[Don’t ask obvious questions. If you’re calling to ask some weird favor, hang up right now.]</p><p>“When did I only call you for favors? That’s hurtful.”</p><p>[You’ve done nothing but that for months now.]</p><p>Ma Hakjun sighed softly, sounding a bit calmer.</p><p>[So then, why are you calling so late?]</p><p>“That young man, Baek Seojin, just left my house.”</p><p>[…The Examiner? Why?]</p><p>“My granddaughter invited him for dinner.”</p><p>[He did save Suhyeon twice, so that makes sense. But why mention it so suddenly? Worried about a public servant visiting your home?]</p><p>Minseong told him that wasn’t it.</p><p>[Then what?]</p><p>“Watching that Examiner got me thinking about someone.”</p><p>[Who? If you say it reminds you of your younger self, I’m hanging up now.]</p><p>Hearing that, Minseong let out a hearty laugh, which soon faded.</p><p>“Hakjun. Do you recall that man?</p><p>[Who do you mean?]</p><p>“Sujin. Hyeon Sujin, her fiancé.”</p><p>Hi readers, we are getting closer to our goal.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 55</h1><p>Unfair. That was the only thought in the head of Jinhan Group&#39;s Honorary Chairman.</p><p>He had built everything from scratch, using every means possible in his youth.</p><p>Starting with loan sharks and pyramid schemes, he eventually expanded into finance, construction, and distribution.</p><p>People still called it a shady business, but he had managed to come this far. Now he was pumping money into politics, gradually gathering superhumans under his wing with vast amounts of cash. He was just beginning to dream beyond being a mid-sized company when...</p><p>&quot;Wow. This is really fancy. Honorary Chairman, they said? Are you living in a palace or something? Or is this where cult leaders stay? Or maybe... a tunnel for a gangster pretending to be human?&quot;</p><p>That dream was crumbling before a monster.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the Honorary Chairman&#39;s seat, giggling, was a woman. She looked barely in her twenties, her youthful glow not yet faded.</p><p>Before her, the Honorary Chairman was kneeling, his head bowed to the floor.</p><p>&#39;How did it come to this? How the hell did it come to this?&#39;</p><p>It all started with an incident caused by his third grandson.</p><p>According to him, an examiner had humiliated him. He wanted to teach that nobody a bitter life lesson. So he tried to hire people to put the man in a difficult situation.</p><p>But as it happened, that examiner was suspected to be an acquaintance of the woman sitting before him, the &quot;Irina&quot; whom even villains called crazy.</p><p>&#39;The boy clearly said he only planned it, didn&#39;t actually do anything.&#39;</p><p>His grandson wouldn&#39;t lie to him. He had been raised to be completely obedient from childhood, so he definitely wouldn&#39;t. Therefore, every word his grandson said must be true.</p><p>Though he was caught in the middle, it only remained an &quot;attempt,&quot; didn&#39;t it? If the police had gotten involved, it might have been smoothed over. Even if they had pressed charges, he could have found a way out.</p><p>But this &quot;crazy woman&quot; refused to let it go.</p><p>And the results were devastating. Irina had immediately stormed in and turned over all his affiliates. Literally by force, unstoppably, to the extent that even public authorities had to back down.</p><p>Immediately after, a sudden massive prosecution investigation followed. All branches were raided and operations completely paralyzed.</p><p>His connections in political circles? All of them shut their mouths and went into hiding.</p><p>No matter how much he reached out, no one would listen.</p><p>Even when he threatened to expose their relationships, they remained unmoved.</p><p>Later, he realized the prosecutors were purely focused on destroying Jinhan. They weren&#39;t planning to drag this into politics; they were answering to someone else. That&#39;s why all his political connections had cut ties and disappeared.</p><p>&quot;Hey.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey. Not answering me? You old geezer?&quot;</p><p>The blond, blue-eyed woman spoke perfect Korean slang. It was shocking on a completely different level than hearing a foreigner shout &quot;Shibal!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-yes, Miss Irina.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Feeling wronged?&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-no. Absolutely not...&quot;</p><p>&quot;That feeling of injustice is written all over your face.&quot;</p><p>Honestly, he couldn&#39;t deny it.</p><p>Getting completely raided by prosecutors, his group torn apart, Beaten down by the mass media, competitors taking advantage to bite chunks out of him. After weathering that storm, he&#39;d barely managed to gather his wits.</p><p>Just when he thought it was over, Irina showed up again. This time with the terrifying statement that she would crush him completely.</p><p>&quot;This time, this time we really had nothing to do with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm. Keep going.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s true. That previous incident, I admit it. I failed to educate my grandson properly. I even beat him up and told him to act like he doesn&#39;t exist at the Academy. He&#39;s not the type to disobey. After that incident, I really didn&#39;t order or plan anything!&quot;</p><p>The chairman pleaded desperately, with sincerity in his voice.</p><p>It was the truth. He and his people really hadn&#39;t done anything.</p><p>Among those who were just trying to live well in the world, not even villains, What madman would think of provoking an S-rank ability user? Especially &quot;Irina&quot;?</p><p>She was a living strategic nuclear weapon. Touch her and you die. What&#39;s worse, other nuclear weapons at least have safety measures and management. This crazy woman had no safety switch. She could go off at any time.</p><p>&quot;Hmm. So, this time you really didn&#39;t do it. Is that right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s correct.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I swear. I swear on everything I&#39;ve built.&quot;</p><p>At that, Irina let out a &quot;hmm&quot; through her nose and stood up.</p><p>The pressure from this woman who had just entered her twenties was unbelievable. And hidden among that creepiness were devastating gestures. Yes, she was definitely crazy, but there was also something inescapably captivating about her.</p><p>&quot;So last time, you admit you were going to do it, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Pardon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Last time. When you tried to hurt my handsome oppa.&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-that matter, Miss Irina already...&quot;</p><p>Crunch—</p><p>Irina&#39;s foot landed on top of the chairman&#39;s head.</p><p>&quot;So back then, you thought I was finished?&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-wasn&#39;t that the case?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It wasn&#39;t. I got dragged away on a dispatch. That&#39;s why I handed it to the prosecutors. But these bastards. They don&#39;t do their job properly? I told them to raid, and they just raided. That&#39;s not how it should be.&quot;</p><p>She said she told them to raid, but complained that they only raided. What kind of nonsensical, literally crazy talk was this!</p><p>But the chairman couldn&#39;t say a word. Advanced society, foundational science, deeply-rooted ideologies. But in this world, ability powers stood above everything else.</p><p>They beat down monsters that no Earth technology could handle.</p><p>They fought villains that even the military couldn&#39;t face. Just for that, ability users were untouchable beings.</p><p>Of course, since they were still people, living among people, They didn&#39;t completely ignore the world&#39;s gaze and judgment. Those who did had already become villains, breaking the world.</p><p>So even S-rank ability users paid some attention to the social atmosphere. They couldn&#39;t live alone, so even while being called demigods, they compromised.</p><p>But not everyone was like that.</p><p>&quot;I hate it when someone touches what&#39;s mine.&quot;</p><p>A madness different from villains, yes. What reflected in those eyes was clearly madness.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s definitely an oppa who can interest me. Just thinking about it gets me so excited. It&#39;s thrilling, almost deadly. But only I can do that. I absolutely can&#39;t tolerate another bitch or bastard scratching him.&quot;</p><p>Fizz—</p><p>Golden light flickered around Irina&#39;s body and disappeared. Cold sweat ran down the chairman&#39;s spine as he witnessed the sight.</p><p>&quot;S-so... what would you like me to do? Please tell me.&quot;</p><p>At the chairman&#39;s words, Irina went &quot;Hmm?&quot; in question. Then she immediately burst into laughter, holding her stomach.</p><p>&quot;Ahh! Ahaha! Ah, ah! This is killing me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll do anything. If you want me to pay compensation to that examiner, I&#39;ll pay as much as needed. If my grandson is the problem, I&#39;ll leave him to your discretion. So please...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey. You still don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying, do you?&quot;</p><p>Irina bent at the waist and looked at the chairman. Seeing the madness swirling in those eyes once again, the chairman could only sigh.</p><p>Could one negotiate with a natural disaster? Surely not. Before an enormous calamity, humans could do nothing.</p><p>*</p><p>[&quot;...Are you going to just let this continue?&quot;]</p><p>&quot;You shouldn&#39;t ask me that. Jiyoon, isn&#39;t this your problem to handle?&quot;</p><p>[&quot;This bitch needs to get her head straight! I don&#39;t know why she suddenly went crazy, but she&#39;s barging in and causing all kinds of trouble. Headmaster, please go take a look.&quot;]</p><p>News about Irina quickly reached Han Jiyoon through the Association.</p><p>In truth, even the Association didn&#39;t have much power to stop her. At best, they could request cooperation from other S-rank ability users. Otherwise, they would have to go beg Irina&#39;s parents again.</p><p>Or they could ask for help from the few individuals Irina was wary of. For example, Ma Hakjun, who was currently on the phone with Han Jiyoon.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m busy.&quot;</p><p>[&quot;No! What if something serious happens!&quot;]</p><p>&quot;What power does an old man like me have? And don&#39;t pass your work onto me.&quot;</p><p>[&quot;That&#39;s too much!&quot;]</p><p>Ding—</p><p>Han Jiyoon hung up with an indignant voice.</p><p>Of course, she wasn&#39;t really offended. She knew it was her job too. It was obvious that to stop an S-rank, you needed another S-rank.</p><p>&quot;Hmm...&quot;</p><p>Ma Hakjun, deeply buried in his chair, sighed. Was it because Irina had caused trouble again? No, not quite. Why worry about someone who wasn&#39;t even an Academy student anymore?</p><p>&quot;Looking at that examiner reminds me of someone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hakjun. Do you remember that man?&quot;</p><p>He had no idea why his friend was suddenly mentioning that time. Ma Hakjun sincerely wanted to strangle his friend.</p><p>&quot;Sujin. Hyeon Sujin, her fiancé.&quot;</p><p>At first, he didn&#39;t understand what he meant. He even cursed about why he was bringing up a story buried deep in the shadows. But then Kang Minseong apologized while firmly continuing:</p><p>&quot;It might sound like nonsense... but they&#39;re similar.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not talking about his appearance or anything like that. What I mean is... he is similar to that man. The way their skills not only blossom but fully bloom all at once. And also how they instantly read the subtle technique shown just before and try to incorporate it into their own body.&quot;</p><p>To that, Ma Hakjun replied that geniuses appear at unexpected times. And he told him to never mention that incident again, in a very stern voice.</p><p>But after ending the call, Ma Hakjun had to bite his lip. Why suddenly bring up that time, that person&#39;s story?</p><p>&quot;Haaah...&quot;</p><p>Sighing once more, Ma Hakjun&#39;s face became lost in thought. He had lived a long life with few regrets, but if he had to name one, It would be that exact moment Kang Minseong had just dredged up.</p>"

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 56</h1><p>There are people who claim to enjoy certain things. Among them, there are three types I absolutely cannot understand.</p><p>People who say studying is too fun.</p><p>People who say mint chocolate is the best.</p><p>And people who say exercise is good.</p><p>&quot;Huff, huff...&quot;</p><p>My combat skills grew automatically each time I clashed with someone. But in contrast, my stamina only reached my inherent limits. If I tried to go beyond that, my body probably wouldn&#39;t hold up.</p><p>In other words, I needed to keep doing evaluations while also building up my stamina. Thanks to that, exercising after work had become an essential routine.</p><p>&quot;Ugh, huk. Haaah...&quot;</p><p>How long had I been running? About, about an hour? My heart felt like it would burst. I thought I could taste blood in my throat.</p><p>I&#39;d never run this long before. Though I had started exercising recently, maybe I overdid it.</p><p>Taking off my cap and running a hand through my hair, I caught my breath.</p><p>&#39;Damn... if I&#39;d known it would be like this, I would have exercised earlier.&#39;</p><p>I regretted it, but how could I have known things would turn out this way? I thought I&#39;d just keep being a civil servant, live like that, and then die. I never dreamed I&#39;d be caught up in such an absurd situation.</p><p>After taking a breath, I slowly straightened my back, which had been bent down. At least as an ability user, my physical condition was better than normal people. My breathing was already returning to normal, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever enjoy exercise. But it seems I have to do it, even just to survive.</p><p>Nothing I can do about it. Even ability users are ultimately physical workers. In that state, not taking care of your body is the same as asking to die.</p><p>&#39;Just 30 more minutes, let&#39;s run for 30 more minutes and then go in.&#39;</p><p>I did some light stretching and was about to pick up speed after turning a corner when—</p><p>Thud—</p><p>&quot;Gyaah!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oof!&quot;</p><p>Something crashed into my chest, and then bounced backward. The impact wasn&#39;t nothing, so my cap fell off.</p><p>For a moment I thought, &#39;Is it a villain?!&#39; but I didn&#39;t feel that sharp sense on my skin. And if it were really a villain, I would&#39;ve already had a knife in my stomach.</p><p>It seemed that as we both turned the corner, neither of us noticed each other. But since my build was much larger, the other person landed on their rear.</p><p>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry. Are you okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah... yes. I&#39;m fine. Are you alright too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I, I think I turned without checking. I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I did the same thing.&quot;</p><p>Though they were wearing a hood, I could immediately tell the other person was a woman. The build, the slender arms and legs.</p><p>...But why was she changing her voice like that? As if she was disguising her real voice, afraid someone might recognize it.</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>I had apologized, and confirmed there were no injuries. I was about to go on my way when the other person shouted &quot;Wait!&quot; and then:</p><p>&quot;Wait! Could it be? It&#39;s you, right? It is!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That man who took a photo with Irina during the Gate incident!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh. Um... that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>&quot;And also the one who did a one-versus-many against villains recently!&quot;</p><p>I did fight against several opponents, but it wasn&#39;t anything like a &quot;one-vs-many.&quot; I just managed to take down one or two of them. And it was Kim Suhyeon who sliced the villain at the end, not me.</p><p>Of course, our journalists didn&#39;t care about any of that. They were busy writing sensational and flashy articles.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s you, right? Right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well... that&#39;s... I mean, yes, it is me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Wow! I, if it&#39;s not too rude, could I take a picture with you?&quot;</p><p>This was suddenly happening in the middle of my workout.</p><p>A picture? Isn&#39;t that something celebrities do? I&#39;m not even a streamer, so why would she...</p><p>No, wait. Thinking about it, this makes sense. In this world, ability users are seen as heroes. And heroes enjoy popularity even greater than celebrities.</p><p>Why call them heroes all of a sudden? If you think about it, it&#39;s obvious. People who fight monsters to save others, defeat villains to protect peace. Saying they&#39;re real-life heroes isn&#39;t wrong at all.</p><p>And come to think of it, my recent actions aligned with both. I might think of myself as just a civil servant or a rank examiner, but To ordinary people, I could be seen as a rising star.</p><p>&quot;One, two, three! Yap!&quot;</p><p>The other person took a selfie with somewhat exaggerated movements. Then after checking the photo, she immediately bowed her head.</p><p>&quot;It was probably a very rude request, but I&#39;m so sorry. And really thank you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing.&quot;</p><p>It didn&#39;t feel like a difficult request or something rude at all. After all, my face was already exposed everywhere thanks to various incidents. Meanwhile, the woman examining the photo from various angles broke into a &quot;hehe!&quot; smile.</p><p>&quot;It came out well! You look better in person than in photos!&quot;</p><p>That line seems to be the same no matter who it&#39;s directed at.</p><p>Of course, my bare face isn&#39;t so pitiful as to need such flattery. The one thing I liked about possessing Baek Seojin was his appearance.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re Baek Seojin, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I am, but that &#39;nim&#39; honorific sounds a bit strange.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? You fought monsters during the Gate incident, and fought villains too! Of course you deserve &#39;nim&#39;! And I heard you already have quite a few fans, did you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fans? Uh, this is completely news to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes! And they&#39;re saying that thanks to you, civil servants are being seen differently!&quot;</p><p>TN: Damn, Baek Seojin raised the prosperity of civil servants.</p><p>Yuyu: More like raised their reputation.</p><p>Now that&#39;s... welcome news. Yes, definitely welcome news. Always getting cursed at, being told they do nothing and their salaries should be cut.</p><p>But civil servants all have their jobs to do. The low-ranking ones especially, have even more. Just handling work? If only that were the case. There are so many odd jobs besides the official work.</p><p>Carrying things when they arrive, stacking them, working again when it rains or snows. If there&#39;s a shortage of people, you have to give up your weekend to work. It&#39;s so bitter. Sometimes when people say nasty things, you&#39;re tempted to just punch them.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s good to hear. I was sad about how terrible civil servant treatment has become recently.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right? That&#39;s why you deserve to be called &#39;nim&#39;!&quot;</p><p>After looking at her for a moment, I unconsciously asked a question.</p><p>&quot;Are you perhaps a streamer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? What? Uh, n-no?! I&#39;m not! Why would you suddenly ask that...&quot;</p><p>&quot;The way you speak seems peculiarly bouncy. Streamers tend to talk like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do I? I do hear that sometimes!&quot;</p><p>But she insisted she really wasn&#39;t a streamer. She wore a very awkward smile.</p><p>&quot;Well, I should go now. I look forward to seeing more of you, Baek Seojin-nim!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mean, I hope you stay strong. Don&#39;t get hurt, teach those bad villains a lesson! Beat up monsters and earn lots of money! Fighting!! Keep exercising hard too!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve never met someone so bouncy. Isn&#39;t she a streamer? That&#39;s exactly how streamers talk. Though I rarely watch streams, so I wouldn&#39;t recognize who she is.</p><p>&quot;Thank you. You exercise hard too.&quot;</p><p>After exchanging brief greetings, I turned away.</p><p>It was a bit sudden, but it didn&#39;t feel bad at all. Rather, it felt a little, how should I say it? Fulfilling. Maybe this is why ability users fight so fiercely.</p><p>Those who fight not just for money or fame, but for something else. At first, I couldn&#39;t understand it, but now I think I get it a little.</p><p>&#39;I should live a bit harder.&#39;</p><p>I put strength back into my legs, which had begun to relax. And I made a promise. Let&#39;s work even harder than now. Since things have come to this, let&#39;s really give it a proper go.</p><p>The evaluations I&#39;m in charge of, the exercise I&#39;m doing now, and...</p><p>&#39;I&#39;ll go home and just play one game before bed.&#39;</p><p>*</p><p>Tadadat—!</p><p>Seo Eunsol hurriedly flipped her hood up and ran hard. Not only was meeting Baek Seojin suddenly surprising, but being asked if she was a streamer?</p><p>&#39;What? Does he know me? Is he perhaps a viewer of my stream?&#39;</p><p>After running and running until her breath reached her chin, Seo Eunsol, aka &quot;Madcat,&quot; finally stopped.</p><p>&quot;Haa, haa...&quot;</p><p>Exhausting. Her chest felt like it would burst. She hadn&#39;t planned to run so frantically. She didn&#39;t even know why she had done so.</p><p>&quot;...&quot;</p><p>After catching her breath for a while, she cautiously took out her phone. Then she quietly examined the selfie she had taken earlier.</p><p>&quot;...He looks much better in person.&quot;</p><p>The photo was plenty handsome. It was, but something was missing. When I saw him directly with my own eyes just now, he was much more handsome.</p><p>&#39;Hero. A superhero.&#39;</p><p>In the past, ability users had saved her when she was about to die from monsters. That&#39;s when she realized. These were the great heroes who would save the world. Superheroes from movies had actually appeared in the real world.</p><p>And the hero she met today was someone who could only be seen in movies. Not arrogant, kind, feeling ordinary, yet truly amazing.</p><p>&quot;The photo came out well. I can use this as stream material today.&quot;</p><p>Of course, she had no intention of showing the photo. There were portrait rights issues, but she also wanted to keep it for herself. It would be the greatest disrespect to post it somewhere and have those vulture journalists pounce on it.</p><p>Seo Eunsol returned home with extremely happy steps. After warming up lightly, she started the game again.</p><p>&#39;Today, I&#39;m definitely, definitely going to reach Silver!&#39;</p><p>She wondered if streaming might break her concentration. So today, she decided to try without broadcasting.</p><p>Her current promotion series was at 1 win, 2 losses. One more loss and she&#39;d drop down again. She had to win. She needed to make it 2 wins, 2 losses. And then she would show the final match on tomorrow&#39;s broadcast.</p><p>&#39;Please, let me have actual humans on my team today, not beasts!&#39;</p><p>Seo Eunsol prayed desperately to the heavens. But there was one fact she overlooked.</p><p>&quot;Aaaaargh!!&quot;</p><p>- Defeat! -</p><p>Even if there were no beasts on her team, only humans, There could be a being on the enemy team that even humans couldn&#39;t handle.</p><p>- PleaseLetMeSilver</p><p>That was the ID of the player who destroyed the game again.</p><p>TN: It would be funny if Madcat somehow passed to silver and become a superhuman because she got examined by Baek Seojin hahaha.</p><p>Hi readers, we are getting closer to our goal.

            "body": "<h1>Chapter 57</h1><p>&quot;Have you heard the news?&quot;</p><p>Today again, Kang Hana who visited the examination hall greeted me with those words instead of a hello. Thinking this might be like a visiting newspaper, I asked, &quot;What news?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jung Yuhyeon. They say he dropped out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dropped out?&quot;</p><p>This was quite unexpected. I didn&#39;t think he would make such a self-destructive move.</p><p>The Ability Academy is a completely different place from an ordinary university. A place where you can drop out and re-enroll? As if that would happen. Once you&#39;re out, that&#39;s it. Whether it was voluntary or forced.</p><p>No matter how hard and painful it is, you have to endure. It&#39;ll be even harder later. If you can&#39;t even stand that and give up, it will be the same later too. With that reasoning, once a student leaves, they never return.</p><p>&quot;What a foolish choice. So many students work hard just to get into the Academy.&quot;</p><p>At my words, Kang Hana nodded in agreement.</p><p>Even though he was demoted to Bronze, he could have worked harder and climbed back up. She muttered that she couldn&#39;t believe he couldn&#39;t endure that momentary embarrassment.</p><p>&#39;Well, that&#39;s not quite it. Unlike others, I was never going to let him rise.&#39;</p><p>Perhaps Jung Yuhyeon had figured out my intentions. Rather than staying in Bronze and collecting academic warnings until being expelled, He&#39;d rather hand in the withdrawal form himself and leave.</p><p>That was perhaps the wiser thought, but it&#39;s still &quot;cold quitting.&quot; Whether you leave on your own or get pushed out, giving up is the same. Didn&#39;t he have the determination to grit his teeth, grow, and get his Silver rank back?</p><p>&#39;Though it&#39;s a shame. I was using him to blow off steam when stressed.&#39;</p><p>For a moment, I worried that he might cause trouble outside. But soon I realized that was a needless concern.</p><p>If he got caught by Irina again, he really wouldn&#39;t survive.</p><p>&quot;And the students&#39; atmosphere seems to have changed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Changed how?&quot;</p><p>Since my job is as an examiner, I can&#39;t leave this examination hall. Therefore, I&#39;ve been gauging student reactions through Kim Suhyeon, Lee Hyunwoo, and Kang Hana.</p><p>But Kim Suhyeon is too busy talking about herself the moment she arrives. Lee Hyunwoo just charges in immediately, so he doesn&#39;t talk about other students.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s gradual, but they seem to be adapting. And some have realized their shortcomings. The number of students staying in the training halls has increased significantly compared to before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s a relief. I was worried there might still be a lot of complaints.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You personally erased those complaints, didn&#39;t you, Examiner?&quot;</p><p>When I was silent for a moment as if asking what she meant, Kang Hana smiled and continued.</p><p>&quot;You know perfectly well. Stopping the monsters during the sudden Gate event, and fighting when villains attacked. Those alone would have had a big impact on the students.&quot;</p><p>I just hope that impact went in a positive direction.</p><p>&#39;I hope it&#39;s &quot;I should become a better ability user like the Examiner!&quot; rather than &quot;I should become an ability user who can gain popularity like the Examiner!&quot; That&#39;s my concern.</p><p>&quot;I can see what you&#39;re thinking, Examiner.&quot;</p><p>Kang Hana continued with a slight smile.</p><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad either. While some people move out of a sense of duty like you, others move because they admire other ability users. As long as it becomes a motivation to work hard, isn&#39;t that enough?&quot;</p><p>After thinking about that for a moment, I nodded. To be honest, I too have reasons beyond duty or a sense of mission.</p><p>Of course, I genuinely want to prevent students from dying senselessly later. Literally, young lives being &quot;washed away&quot; is not a pleasant sight. But that reason alone isn&#39;t why I speak and act as I do.</p><p>&quot;Examiner Baek Seojin.&quot;</p><p>Turning my head slightly, I saw what looked like a security officer looking at me.</p><p>&quot;The Headmaster is calling for you. We&#39;ll handle the examination duties briefly.&quot;</p><p>Ma Hakjun is calling for me again. What could it be this time? As I followed the security officer, I pondered but couldn&#39;t think of anything.</p><p>&#39;It&#39;s not like I broke someone&#39;s ribs again this time.&#39;</p><p>Come to think of it, that tattoo thug. What was his name...ah, right. Park Junwoo. I wonder what he&#39;s doing now. He hasn&#39;t been seen since that day. Did this bastard drop out too? Afraid something else might get broken?</p><p>&quot;Headmaster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come in.&quot;</p><p>As the security officer nodded, I opened the door and went inside.</p><p>Nothing had changed from last time. A remarkably ordinary place for someone who was once a hero. I think even a regular university president&#39;s office would look more impressive.</p><p>&quot;I heard you called for me, Headmaster.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Welcome. And I apologize for calling someone who was focusing on their work.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s fine. It was a quiet time after lunch anyway.&quot;</p><p>Ma Hakjun offered me a seat and then brewed a cup of coffee. A civil servant having coffee served by the headmaster? I might really be getting famous.</p><p>&quot;I got a call from that friend of mine.&quot;</p><p>Ma Hakjun has several friends. But the one he&#39;s talking about is probably...</p><p>&quot;You mean Chairman Kang Minseong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chairman my ass. What kind of goddamn chairman. He&#39;s just a pathetic old fool who can&#39;t live up to his age.&quot;</p><p>I almost said, &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; without thinking.</p><p>It&#39;s okay if I curse someone, but not when others do it. That&#39;s what real friendship is, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>&quot;He does love his granddaughter intensely. He couldn&#39;t stop smiling when talking about her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s why he&#39;s pathetic. Do you know how exhausting he&#39;s made things for me?&quot;</p><p>For reference, Ma Hakjun is not the type to make idle talk. So those words meant he was genuinely annoyed and heated because of Kang Minseong.</p><p>&quot;As you probably know by now, Suhyeon—that is, student Kim Suhyeon—has a sad past.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard about that from Chairman Kang Minseong.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He must really like you to have told you about that.&quot;</p><p>Kim Suhyeon lost her mother when she was young. Not in an accident, but in battle. She was reportedly an excellent ability user. And Kim Suhyeon awakened her ability taking after her grandfather and mother. But she couldn&#39;t achieve the same level of power as those two, which fueled her inferiority complex.</p><p>&quot;It was a sad incident.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A sad incident indeed. People are all like that. Everyone has a terribly unfortunate past.&quot;</p><p>After taking a sip of coffee, Ma Hakjun was silent for a moment before continuing.</p><p>&quot;In my case too, I lost many friends in the early days of the Gate era. And later, I lost my son. Although much time has passed, I can still faintly recall it. The day my son passed.&quot;</p><p>I couldn&#39;t say anything in response to Ma Hakjun&#39;s words.</p><p>They say a child who loses parents is pitiful, but parents who lose a child are even more so. I&#39;ve heard that the stress of a child dying is terrible even when one is old enough to die. Let alone if they died in their prime, that would be a nightmare you&#39;d never want to recall.</p><p>&quot;...I&#39;m sorry to hear that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s been quite a while now, so it&#39;s blurry.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s a lie. That&#39;s not the look of someone whose memories are blurry. He probably won&#39;t forget until he dies. The face of his child, smiling brightly.</p><p>Once while passing through the streets, I saw victims of a Gate incident. They died indiscriminately—men, women, old, young. Among them were many young students. Even now, I can&#39;t forget the screams of those children&#39;s parents.</p><p>Those screams were more horrible than a beast&#39;s howl.</p><p>Even though they were people I had no connection with, my heart was torn. Seeing that, I wished that friends in their prime wouldn&#39;t die anymore.</p><p>Perhaps what I told the students—that I didn&#39;t want them to die— Might have been influenced by the shock I received back then.</p><p>&quot;What about you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you alright? When you go through these things, you naturally start wondering if others are okay. If they might have even darker, deeper pasts than yours.&quot;</p><p>For a moment, I was a bit confused.</p><p>The memories remaining in this body are a mixture of &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;the original Baek Seojin&#39;s.&quot; So I remember them, but the emotions that should naturally arise don&#39;t surface.</p><p>&quot;I lost my parents when I was young too. And all my relatives, everyone.&quot;</p><p>Like right now, saying I lost all my parents and relatives and became an orphan. But as I say it, I don&#39;t feel any particular emotion, not even sadness.</p><p>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to recall that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fortunately, it was when I was young, so it&#39;s blurry. Rather, what came after was so hard that I forgot everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. I understand. Yes. You too must have gone through very difficult times.&quot;</p><p>After taking another sip of coffee, Ma Hakjun apologized for bringing up such topics. The reason he called me wasn&#39;t this, and he said he&#39;d spoiled the mood with a strange subject.</p><p>&quot;Examiner Baek Seojin. The reason I called you again is that I have a favor to ask.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If it&#39;s something I can do, I&#39;ll help with all my strength.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s reassuring to hear.&quot;</p><p>With those words, Ma Hakjun turned and grabbed something from the work table behind him.</p><p>&quot;This is it. The favor I want to ask you.&quot;</p><p>What he handed me were documents listing several schedules. As I looked them over, I let out an &quot;Uh&quot; of surprise.</p><p>&quot;...Headmaster. Surely, you&#39;re not asking me to...&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s exactly right. What I want to ask you is just that.&quot;</p><p>I checked the documents in my hand again, thinking I might have seen wrong.</p><p>[Gold ~ Platinum Rank Practical Training Plan – External Support Case]</p><p>[Team 5 Leading Professor: _ _ _ ]</p><p>&quot;Are you serious?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p><p>Regardless of my shocked reaction, Ma Hakjun continued.</p><p>&quot;I want you to take on the role of substitute professor for this practical training session for Gold and Platinum ranks, specifically for the external support case.&quot;</p><p>Hi readers, sorry for the late upload, website was down when I had the free time for upload.</p><p>And we are getting closer to our goal.
