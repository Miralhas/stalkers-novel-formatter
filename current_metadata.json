    "description": "<p>Wang Lin was a bright and kindhearted boy raised by loving parents. Despite being shunned by their relatives, his parents always held hope that their son would rise above and achieve greatness. When an opportunity to pursue immortality finally came, Wang Lin eagerly stepped onto the path of cultivationâ€”only to discover that his talent was mediocre at best.</p><p>But this is not a tale of natural-born genius.</p><p>Through unyielding determination, sharp wit, and sheer willpower, Wang Lin embarks on a relentless journey to overcome his limitations. Along the way, he faces brutal enemies, makes powerful allies, and slowly transforms from a naive youth into a ruthless, cunning cultivator who defies both heaven and fate itself.</p><p>In a world where strength dictates survival, and immortality is a distant dream for most, Wang Lin perseveres, fueled by determination and wisdom. As he navigates the treacherous path of cultivation, his journey inspires both awe and respect, leaving behind a legacy that will not easily be forgotten.</p>",
